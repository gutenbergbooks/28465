<h3>VALENTIA</h3>


<p>"Romer, are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Valentia, do I ever do anything else?"</p>

<p>"I've almost decided and absolutely made
up my mind that it will look ever so much
better if you don't go with me to Harry's
dinner after all."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We two&mdash;you <i>and</i> I&mdash;always seem to
make such an enormous family party! Of
course, I know we have to go about in these huge
batches sometimes&mdash;to your mother, and that
sort of thing, but in this case it will look better
not."</p>

<p>Valentia made this rather ungracious suggestion,
looking so pretty, so serious, and yet
with such a conciliating smile that it would have
been almost impossible for even the most touchy
person to have been offended.</p>

<p>The tall, significant-looking husband stopped
in his stroll across the room.</p>

<p>It was a charming room, with pale grey walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and a pale green carpet, and very little in it
except, let in as a panel, a delicate low-toned
portrait of the mistress of the house, vaguely
appearing through vaporous curtains, holding
pale flowers, and painted with a rather mysterious
effect by that talented young amateur, her
cousin, Harry de Freyne. It had been his sole
success in art, and had been exhibited at the
Grafton Galleries under the name of The
Gilded Lily. No one had ever known or was
ever likely to know whether the title referred
to the decorative, if botanically impossible,
blossom in her hand, or to the golden hair of the
seductive sitter.</p>

<p>Romer Wyburn paused a moment&mdash;he always
paused before speaking&mdash;and then said
very slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Really? You think it will look better
if I don't go with you?"</p>

<p>He invariably spoke with the greatest deliberation,
and with no expression whatever.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, dear, I'm sure it would," she
repeated coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean if you go without me?"</p>

<p>"What else can I mean?"</p>

<p>"It'll look better, you think; eh? Is that the
idea?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>He sat down opposite the portrait, lighted a
cigarette, and thought. Then he said with
ruminating interest&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't see why. Why will it look so much
better for me not to go with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Romer dear, really! It's one of those
things that are almost impossible to explain.
Oh, if you'd only do just what I advise&mdash;if
you'd only <i>go</i> by me, and not want these long
tedious explanations, how much better it would
be! You see, Harry is giving this dinner <i>on
purpose</i> so that Daphne shall meet Van Buren
by accident. You know all about Van Buren, <i>the</i>
Van Buren&mdash;the millionaire, who turns out to
be a dear creature and quite charming! and has
taken the <i>greatest</i> fancy to Harry, and clings on
to him, and keeps on and on asking him to ask
him to meet people. You must own it would be
rather jolly for Daphne, because, of course, you
can't <i>think</i> how he's run after&mdash;I mean Van
Buren&mdash;and he isn't an ordinary American
snob, and it really and truly isn't only his
millionairishness, but he's a real person, and
good-looking and nice as well; and though,
Heaven knows, I'm as romantic as anybody&mdash;for
myself&mdash;I wouldn't be so selfish as to be
romantic for her too, and I can't help feeling it's
our duty, being in the place of parents to her,
to give the angel a sporting chance! Of course,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>the point is, Van Buren has told Harry he only
likes nice English girls very well brought up,
and he wants to settle down in England, and he
thinks that any relation of Harry's must be perfect;
and, naturally, I'm pleased. I feel exactly
like a mother to Daphne, although she's only
six years younger."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right. I see all that."</p>

<p>Romer seemed rather bored, as men naturally
are at a long catalogue of another man's
advantages. "Now, look here. Why would it
look better for me not to go?"</p>

<p>There was some excuse for his insistence on
this point, for in a superficial way Romer was
very effective, fair and good-looking, well-made
and distinguished; but the entire absence
of all expression from his empty, regular face,
and of all animation from his dry, colourless
voice and manner, soon counteracted the
effectiveness. Valentia often said that Romer
should never do more than walk through a
room or look in for a few minutes where there
were other people&mdash;even at a club&mdash;and then
go away immediately, when he would leave a
striking impression. If he stayed longer he became
alarming. His personality was so extraordinarily
<i>nil</i> that it was quite oppressive.
Obviously kind and not in the least pompous,
yet his silence made him formidable, especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>to most of his wife's friends who, though they
could hardly be reproached with want of pluck
as a general rule, had one great fear in life&mdash;the
fear of being bored. It was on this ground
that they were all terrified of Romer.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Romer, if we both go it
will look too marked? Almost as if we were
vulgarly trying to get Daphne married? A
horrid idea! Besides, if you don't turn up Harry
can ask some one amusing in your place. You see,
he's promised to show Van Buren <i>interesting</i>
people.... No, darling, I don't mean it in that
way. I'm sure you're interesting enough, but
I mean queer people, and celebrities and things.
That's what Van Buren wants, and that's what
he must have. And that's one reason why he's
so delighted with Harry, because Harry can get
them all, through being a sort of artist, you see.
What a good thing, after all, that he didn't
drift into diplomacy! As he's an American you
can't expect Van Buren to be really modern,
and he has all the <a class="ins" href="#tnote_1"  name="tAnchor_1" title="old-fashoned">old-fashioned</a> ideas about
what <i>he</i> calls culture. He wants to go in for
being intellectual and artistic and knowing what
he calls people with brains who really count.
I mean he wants to meet people like Seymour
Hicks and Waller, and Thomas Hardy, and so
on, and not only celebrities and people who have
made their name, but even people with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>future, and, in fact, any peculiar, well-educated
creatures&mdash;anything out of the way."</p>

<p>Romer looked rather dazed.</p>

<p>"Really? Then will Hicks or Hardy be asked
in my place?"</p>

<p>Valentia laughed. "Don't be so absurdly
literal and hopelessly idiotic, darling! No, of
course not. But I dare say Harry will get&mdash;well&mdash;perhaps
Rathbone, the tattooed man, his
Oxford friend."</p>

<p>"Really! And will this chap's being tattooed
make the party go off better?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Romer dear; in a sort of way,
because it makes him interesting, although you
can't see it. When he was quite young he was
always having lifelong passions for people, and
being tattooed in their honour. He has blue
chain bracelets with initials on his left wrist, and
a heart and an anchor with other initials on
his right arm, and a flight of swallows&mdash;oh, and
goodness knows what! In fact, when you come
to think of it Mr. Rathbone is really a kind of
serial story&mdash;with illustrations. I wonder Lord
Northcliffe doesn't bring him out in monthly
parts!" She laughed again. "Harry might even
get Hereford Vaughan, the man who has
written all the plays that are going on now.
Harry knows him quite well, and Van Buren
would be so pleased."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>"Does Daphne want to many this American
chap?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no! The idea! Why, she
doesn't even know him!... Yes, of course she
does, naturally."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Romer, though he never by any chance
smiled at his wife's careless irresponsible chatter,
nor laughed at her trivial jests, took the deepest
interest in them, and would listen, as if under a
charm, by the hour, to subtleties and frivolities
that one would never have imagined he would
enjoy. Sometimes the faint shadow of a smile
would illuminate his face like a cold ray of
wintry moonlight, but that was when she had
ceased speaking. The smile was the effect of
having watched the sparkle of her grey eyes,
the expression of her pretty mouth, and her
brilliant, sunshiny grace.</p>

<p>"It's very sweet of Harry," she said thoughtfully,
"to do all this for me. It's all for me, or
rather it's all for Daphne; he's so fond of
Daphne."</p>

<p>"Really? Why doesn't he marry her himself?"</p>

<p>She looked surprised and blushed slightly.</p>

<p>"Harry? Why, he never marries!"</p>

<p>"He doesn't as a rule, I know," Romer admitted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>"Then, why should he make an exception for
Daphne? He's fond of her&mdash;of us&mdash;in fact,
devoted&mdash;just like a brother. Not that I ever
saw a devoted brother. Besides, Harry's made
to be a bachelor, and he isn't well off enough
to marry."</p>

<p>"Really? Hard up? Poor chap! Never saw
any sign of it."</p>

<p>"Hard up? No; how like you! Of course, he
has plenty of money, for <i>him</i>, but he spends it
all, poor boy. Anyhow, of course, he's not really
rich like Van Buren. It's on a totally different
scale&mdash;a different sort of thing altogether. But,
of course, Van Buren may not care for Daphne;
people have such funny tastes; and not only
that, but if he adores and worships the ground
she treads on I shan't let her dream of marrying
him unless she absolutely returns it&mdash;at least,
unless she likes him fairly well."</p>

<p>All this seemed to absorb Romer, and after a
pause he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll get Daphne a new dress for
Harry's beano?"</p>

<p>Valentia smiled pityingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, you would think that. No!
Why, that would be <i>l'enfance de l'art</i>! First of
all, Daphne looks ever so much better when
she's dressed really simply, not the latest
fashion; on the very verge of dowdiness! It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>suits her&mdash;shows her off. It would be silly to
dress her up like a doll or make her look <i>endimanch&eacute;e</i>
on Thursday, or arranged and got up
expensively, on purpose for Van Buren. I
wouldn't, for instance, for anything, let her
wear her new tulle dress from Armand! He'd
see through it. Besides, I want her to contrast
with me as if I'd taken any amount of trouble
about my own appearance and none about hers.
It'll make him pity her a little, and think how
well she'd look in the sort of clothes he could
give her. Besides, I myself am not going to be
very smart&mdash;just tidy."</p>

<p>"Paquin?"</p>

<p>"How clever of you to guess! Well, now I
must go and see Harry and hear all about the
dinner, and tell him how sorry you are you
can't come. And you're going to lunch at the
Club, aren't you? And won't you go and dine
with your mother on that evening?"</p>

<p>"I may as well."</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i>, Romer dear! I can't bear you to neglect
her, although I never think it's safe to let you
dine with her without me. She always takes
advantage of my absence to be horrid about
me, and then you <i>will</i> defend me, although I've
implored you not to heaps of times, and then
you quarrel. If, this time, she says I'm frivolous
and worldly and an utter fool and very deep, you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>must agree with every word. I'm so fond of her,
she's such a dear thing, it's too bad to worry her
by contradicting her, and she has such a vile
temper! Telephone and invite yourself&mdash;a pressing
invitation, and give her my very best love."</p>

<p>Romer promised all she asked and then went
out to the Club.</p>

<p>Valentia watched him through the window as
he went. She thought he looked very well
through a window, and ought by rights always
to be seen in that way&mdash;as it were, under glass.
She felt quite proud of him, of his smart
appearance. In his way, he was an elaborate
dandy, and spent years at his tailor's, slowly
choosing the right thing. She remembered she
had married him chiefly because of his fine
presence and mysterious silence. She had
thought at the time there must be so much at
the back of it all, so much in him. He was in
love with her and seemed difficult to understand.
What could be more attractive? And now&mdash;well,
he was ideally kind and good-natured.
And she certainly felt sometimes that she
couldn't even yet quite make him out. Then she
gave a slight sigh, went to the door and called
Daphne.</p>

<p>Daphne came in, trimming a hat. She had
lived with the Wyburns ever since their
marriage five years ago, and Valentia, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>no children and a most passionately tender
disposition&mdash;far too much natural affection to
expend on Romer alone&mdash;lavished devotion on
her sister. And Daphne was so nice and so
pretty, almost as pretty as herself, in a satisfactorily
different way. Valentia with her short
straight features, grey eyes under dark brows,
low forehead almost hidden by wavy fair hair,
and a mouth curved and curled into subtle and
complicated lines, was the type loved by Rossetti
and Burne-Jones. She had a wonderful
fair complexion, against which her long eyelashes
showed, when she looked down, dark and
effective, and though she was rather tall, slim
and very modishly dressed, she never looked
like a fashion-plate and had no air of being a
mere mannequin for clothes, but seemed
essentially real, with a suggestion in her personality
of a beauty at once pagan and spiritual&mdash;the
pagan predominating. Her pictorial
appearance had no doubt made easier the artist's
task, and the pale exquisite portrait had truly
been described as a whispering likeness.</p>

<p>Daphne, who was not quite eighteen, was a
good deal taller, and more slender. She had
dark brown eyes, smooth dark hair, parted in
the middle, a rather bright colour and features
of the classic type. Her chin was rather long,
and she had a brilliant, sudden smile, and all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the attractive freshness and slight abruptness
of her age, with an occasionally subdued air,
caused by the shadow that had fallen on their
youth by the death of their beautiful mother.
Her gentle grace and touch of premeditated
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> made her charming. Beyond question
she would be a great success.</p>

<p>"Romer can't go on Thursday," Valentia
said, taking the needle and hat out of her sister's
hand and beginning to sew. "I must go and see
Harry and tell him to get some one else. Really,
Daphne, you go too far! It's all very well to be
clever with your needle, but you needn't tear
a Lewis hat to pieces and turn it inside out
without asking my advice."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't! I was only squashing in the
brim and trying to make the hat smaller. It
seems to have got larger since I put it away."</p>

<p>"Don't be perfectly absurd, darling. It's
because you've been seeing smaller hats lately."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I see. Who's going instead of
Romer?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? We'll see."</p>

<p>"It's just as you like, darling," said Daphne
in her level voice; "but in case the American
hates me, and I hate him, and Harry's talking
to you all the time, and I'm frightened of the
celebrities, isn't anything going to be done for
me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>"Of course not. What do you want? That
Foster boy again? Don't look down and blush,
it makes me sick. All right, perhaps, if there's
room. He's a nice, decorative boy, but remember
they don't dance at dinner, and that's the only
thing he can do."</p>

<p>"Indeed it isn't!" cried Daphne.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to hear it. Suppose Foster's
engaged, or at Aldershot?"</p>

<p>"He won't be. It's too sweet of Romer not
going. Did you marry him because you knew
he would do whatever you told him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it was that so much," said
Valentia, thoughtfully, trying on the hat in
front of the glass. "I thought he was a strong
silent man, a man with an orange up his sleeve,
as it were. But I've never seen the orange."</p>

<p>"How funny of you! I should hate a mysterious
person. You don't want your husband to be
a kind of conjurer."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, as long as he doesn't wear a
conjurer's evening dress. I like being surprised.
Now let's go and surprise Harry at his studio;
we must be quick, he's expecting us."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>HARRY</h3>


<p>Harry de Freyne stood in his usual
position, smoking a cigarette, and leaning
a little forward, with his back to the mirror as
if to resist the temptation of looking into it.
The family good looks were acutely accentuated
in this young man. He had the smooth, glossy
dark hair, white teeth, and speaking dark grey
eyes that women like; clearly-cut features, and
the rather prominent chin, generally and
mistakenly supposed to show strength of
character. His pleasant, clean-shaven, slightly
sunburnt face bore an expression of animation
with a certain humorous anxiety natural in a
man who was generally a good deal in debt and
always a little in love. Further he had the
advantage of a tall, strong yet supple figure,
with a natural grace of movement and much
personal charm. Harry knew he was good-looking
and did not undervalue the fact, but
regarded it solely as an asset, not as a private
satisfaction. He regarded everything as an asset.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>He was no fop, although he wore a single
eye-glass rather as a concession to some
ideal of dandyism than as a help to clear
vision. He could see remarkably well, with or
without it.</p>

<p>The long Empire mirror was placed above a
delightful early English large open fireplace, in
which burnt a Parisian-looking wood fire. Harry
was the possessor of a fine&mdash;indeed, a magnificent
studio, full of good old things, chiefly
other people's, and bad new things, principally
his own. The theory that all bad art is the result
of sincere feeling was certainly not exemplified
in his case. The portrait of his cousin that had
been regarded as so full of promise was, as
he always, said, the only decent piece of work
he had ever done. He had been educated for
diplomacy, and learnt eight languages, some of
which he spoke fluently, and in all of which
he could look with expression.</p>

<p>The room was no mere exhibition of bric-&agrave;-brac,
but was a cosy, shadowy, miscellaneous
place, not without an ecclesiastical touch here
and there. One felt every subject could be
gone into there, from stockbroking to love, and
that everything could be done there, whether
it was praying, eating, singing, or flirting&mdash;everything
except perhaps painting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>When the servant announced Mrs. Wyburn
and Miss de Freyne one might have fancied
Harry looked slightly disappointed, but he
greeted the pretty creatures with suitable
effusion and high spirits.</p>

<p>They both sat down rather carefully in the
corner seats by the fire.</p>

<p>"Romer can't come, he's dining with his
mother," announced Valentia. "He ought to,
you know, now and then."</p>

<p>"I don't like her," said Daphne, "she abuses
every one."</p>

<p>"I know she does, but she's really not so bad,
dear, all the same; there are many worse. She's
rather spiteful, but warmhearted&mdash;awfully
kind if you break your leg," said Valentia.</p>

<p>"But you don't break your leg," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes you do. At any rate you
might. Don't encourage Daphne to argue,
Harry. Who did you say you'd ask instead if we
couldn't get Romer?"</p>

<p>"Rathbone's just written to accept in his
place," said Harry, taking out a letter. "But&mdash;don't
you think we could persuade Romer if we
tried hard? However, you know best."</p>

<p>He took out a list. "Hereford Vaughan, Van
Buren, Rathbone and me&mdash;that's four; you
two, Lady Walmer, and Miss Luscombe, the
actress. I think that'll do."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>"Lady Walmer?" repeated Valentia. "Why?"</p>

<p>"And a real actress!" murmured Daphne.</p>

<p>"Not a real actress. She's walked on at all the
principal theatres in London, and somebody's
always going to take a theatre for her, but
there's no danger. I told Van Buren that on the
stage they think she's in society, and in society
they believe she's on the stage. And he thinks
it's real cute, and an extraordinary English
type."</p>

<p>"How are you getting on with him?"</p>

<p>"Beautifully,&mdash;if he weren't so beastly intelligent
and inquisitive. He always wants to
know all the news and all the latest gossip.
What do you think he asked me last night?
Why Big Ben was called Big Ben! How on earth
should I know!"</p>

<p>"Big who?"</p>

<p>"Not big anybody;&mdash;the place, the thing;&mdash;the
clock. He said no doubt I must think him
dreadfully ignorant for not knowing, but he
felt he must ask."</p>

<p>Smiling at the recollection, Harry lighted
another cigarette.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" Daphne asked.</p>

<p>"If it had been the afternoon I think I'd have
taken the risk and told him I didn't know, but
as it was the evening&mdash;he always gets rather
excited in the evening after dinner and so much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Perrier water,&mdash;walking back to the Ritz in the
moonlight, and talking about London, I invented
a long story.&mdash;No, he won't repeat it,
don't be frightened; it was really rather awful;
and when Van Buren gives you his word of
honour not to tell a thing ..."</p>

<p>"You're all right! That must be a great help,"
said Valentia sympathetically.</p>

<p>"It shows he has a nice loyal nature,"
Daphne remarked. "I admire that sort of thing
very much."</p>

<p>"A nice loyal nature! I should think he has!
He hates spreading scandal, and he wouldn't
say a single word now to take away the
character of Big Ben&mdash;if it was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if it was ever so! You ought to make
Daphne wear one of those thin tulle veils to
match her hat. They're jolly&mdash;you can get
them at that shop close to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, she needn't, she's going to be manicured,
and she's coming back here for me in a
quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, darling," said Daphne, standing
up, and she made a kind of face, which Valentia
understood to mean the word Foster.</p>

<p>"What is the child playing at?" said Harry.
"If you two have a code it would be as well to
learn it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>"All right," said Valentia to Daphne.</p>

<p>Harry walked with her to the door and she
ran out, saying, "I won't be long."</p>

<p>"She wants Foster, the baby Guardsman,"
explained Valentia.</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you say so at first? Of course
I suppose they've arranged it. At any rate it's
as good as done. Then there must be one more
woman. But never mind now."</p>

<p>Harry sat down beside her and said, in a
different voice&mdash;he had a very good voice,
especially when he spoke caressingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"How interesting you are! One of your eyebrows
is a little thicker than the other."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!..."</p>

<p>"How are we all going to get home that
evening?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this, as you may say. We'll all
meet at the Ritz and dine there. Good. Then we
drive in separate vehicles to here, and have
some music. Then I see you both home, and&mdash;well,
I think that's all. It's not much."</p>

<p>"I don't quite like the way Lady Walmer
looks at you, Harry."</p>

<p>"Oh, Valentia! If it comes to that, how do you
fondly imagine I shall like the way Rathbone is
sure to look at you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry! Why, he's tattooed!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>"You see," went on Harry seriously, "I
really am making a dash for it about Daphne.
She'll really be happy with Van Buren, and <i>I</i>
shall be ever so much happier,&mdash;with Van
Buren and everyone else,&mdash;because, through
Daphne being always with you, I never see you
alone for one single second."</p>

<p>"Oh, you exaggerate, Harry!"</p>

<p>"I know I do. I don't see you for half a
second."</p>

<p>"Romer has been so nice lately," she answered
gently.</p>

<p>"Very amusing, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I often think how very nice he really
is."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that, even in fun. I'm coming
to stay with you in the summer&mdash;at the Green
Gate&mdash;unless you'd rather ask Rathbone instead."</p>

<p>"Or unless you'd rather go yachting with the
Walmers," she remarked. "They have a
daughter, haven't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Valentia, be anything but blasphemous!..."</p>

<p>"Really?... Oh, Harry!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you need my saying it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, I will. Valentia, I&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>She got up and opened the door so that
Daphne should not have to ring when she
returned.</p>

<p>When the two sisters left a few minutes
later, Harry sat down again as if in deep
thought and lighted a cigarette. His servant
came in.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, Mr. Van Buren is at the
telephone."</p>

<p>"Oh well, tell him ... Oh no&mdash;, all right&mdash;I'll
go."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>VAN BUREN</h3>


<p>"It's extremely kind of you, Harry, to let
me come around like this in the morning.
I dare say you want to be working sometimes.
I'm really afraid of being in the way, but I
was rather at a loose end this morning and I
wanted to have a talk with you," said Van
Buren apologetically.</p>

<p>"Rot. Awfully glad to see you, old chap.
Have a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Harry, no. I find I'm very much
better if I don't smoke till after tea.... We're
intimate friends now, and yet you never call
me anything but my surname, or <a class="ins" href="#tnote_2"  name="tAnchor_2" title=",old chap'">'old chap'</a>.
That reminds me, there's a little request I'd
like to make of you, Harry."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Call me Matthew&mdash;no, call me plain Mat. It
would give me real pleasure."</p>

<p>Harry smiled rather loudly&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I couldn't call you plain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Mat. It wouldn't be suitable! You're too good-looking!"</p>

<p>Van Buren smiled and shook his head. In its
way it was a handsome head in the fair, clean-shaven
American style, with shining blond hair.
He had very broad shoulders, and a very thin waist,
and that na&iuml;ve worldliness of air so captivating in
many of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Except that he wore a buttonhole of Parma
violets, he was dressed in every particular
exactly like Harry. But no one would have believed
it&mdash;he looked so much better dressed.</p>

<p>"That's your chaff, Harry. I'm not a Gibson
man, and I don't pretend to be."</p>

<p>He looked at his hands, which were small and
white, the finger-tips brilliantly polished, and
said meditatively&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm very much looking forward to meeting
your cousin, Harry. I expect she's the ideal of
a young English lady. Dark, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Rather dark, and very pretty."</p>

<p>"It's a curious thing, Harry, that to me a broonette
has always more fascination than a blonde.
It seems&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;as though there's
more piquancy, more character."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Harry. "Now
the sister&mdash;the married one&mdash;is very fair."</p>

<p>"And she's quite what you call a professional
beauty, isn't she?" asked Van Buren with great
relish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>"My dear fellow, I don't call anyone a professional
beauty, and you mustn't either. There's
no such thing. I can't think how in America you
get hold of these prehistoric phrases! The expression
must have been dead long before either of
us was born!... Still, she is a beauty all the
same."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Mind you, Harry, there's something
very attractive about a blonde, too. To me
golden hair and blue eyes suggest gentleness and
womanliness.... What is Mrs. Wyburn like?"</p>

<p>"Well, she's rather like an angel on a Christmas
card, with her hair down&mdash;I mean she was,
as a little girl," said Harry quickly. "Now she's
considered like 'Love among the Roses' by
Burne-Jones."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that, Harry? Why, she
must be more beautiful than Miss de Freyne!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about her, if I were you,"
Harry said.</p>

<p>"Why not, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see she's got a husband," said
Harry, looking at the ceiling as he puffed his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"And a cousin," replied Van Buren with unexpected
quickness. He then burst out laughing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>"What do you mean?" asked Harry, not laughing.</p>

<p>"Harry, I do beg of you to forgive my indiscretion.
I'm afraid you'll think it shows great
want of delicacy on my part. It was only meant
for English chaff. Don't be angry, Harry." Van
Buren was quite distressed.</p>

<p>"That's all right, old chap."</p>

<p>"You see, I know you painted her portrait,
and if you <i>had</i> felt a little sentiment for her,
who could blame you? Of course, I'm well aware
that you're far too much a man of high principle
to come any way between a woman and
her husband, or even to let her know if you had
a fancy in that direction.... I thoroughly do
you justice there, Harry."</p>

<p>"I regard them as sisters," answered Harry.</p>

<p>Van Buren went to the window and stood
looking out for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Well, they are sisters.... What a wonderful
place your London is!" he said. "Now there's
the sort of thing I never can understand, which
has just happened. A lady called a taxicab. Just
as it came up a man&mdash;at least I suppose he calls
himself a man&mdash;opened the door. I thought he
meant to help her in. No! He got in himself and
drove away.&mdash;Now, Harry, how do you account
for that?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he could walk quicker," said Harry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>"It's the one fault I have to find with you
Englishmen, Harry&mdash;the single fault. You're
not gallant enough to the ladies. Nor is there, in
my opinion, quite enough respect shown to
them. I am always astonished, I admit, that
they don't resent it. Why, in New York&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, they complain bitterly that
there's too much respect shown to them already,"
said Harry. "A little more, and they'd
do without us altogether!"</p>

<p>Van Buren laughed cheerily, and clapped
Harry on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"What a fellow you are for chaff! Now, will
you come around and have lunch with me?"</p>

<p>"When? Now? Thanks, old chap."</p>

<p>"That's real good, Harry," said Van Buren,
his eyes sparkling with joy, "and we'll walk
down Piccadilly together. I must say ..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I shan't feel we're real pals till you call me
Mat!"</p>

<p>Harry shivered ostentatiously.</p>

<p>They went out, both laughing with great
cordiality.</p>

<p>At the corner Van Buren stopped to throw
away his buttonhole. He saw they were not
being worn.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE ELDER MRS. WYBURN</h3>


<p>Romer's mother usually received him with
a sarcastic remark, such as "Oh, so you remember
that I'm not dead yet?" or "I wonder
you find time to come at all," or something of
the same nature, calculated to cast a gloom over
any visit.</p>

<p>The widow of a rich brewer, Mrs. Wyburn
lived in a bad-tempered looking old house in
Curzon Street, with a harassed footman, a
domineering maid, a cross cook, and other servants
that were continually changing. She was
one of those excellent housekeepers who spend
most of their time "giving notice" and "taking
up" characters. She nearly always wore a hard-looking
black silk dress. She had parted black
hair, long earrings, and a knot of rare old imitation
lace at her throat. Eagerness, impatience,
love of teasing and sharp wit were visible in her
face to one who could read between the lines.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>But, notwithstanding this, as she had a soft
heart and plenty of hard cash, she was not altogether
unpopular. People enjoyed going to
hear the nasty things she said about their friends.
She had a real <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i> on her Wednesdays,
notwithstanding the fact that a more
highly respectable lady had never existed in the
world.</p>

<p>She adored Romer, although his slow speech
and long pauses often drove her to the very
verge of violence.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd look in," he remarked, rather
heavily taking a seat in the dark drawing-room,
and he proceeded by slow stages to tell her that
he was coming to dinner on Thursday because
Valentia was going out.</p>

<p>She gave him a quick look, combined of
motherly pride and annoyance.</p>

<p>"Delighted, of course, dear. Who did you say
was Valentia's hostess?"</p>

<p>"She's going with Daphne. Harry's dinner.
At some restaurant."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!... Well, if you approve of
these Bohemian arrangements it's not <i>my</i> business.
I have my own opinion of Harry de
Freyne; I always have had&mdash;and I shall keep it."</p>

<p>"Do," said Romer, unconsciously epigrammatic.</p>

<p>She waited a minute and then said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>"I don't wish to worry you, my dear ..."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"... But I, personally, if I were a man ...
perhaps I oughtn't to say it&mdash;if I saw my wife
so much in the society of a person like Harry de
Freyne&mdash;upon my word, I should begin to ask
myself what were their relations!"</p>

<p>"Cousins," said Romer.</p>

<p>He began to tap his foot slowly against the
rail of the chair, but remembered Valentia's
constant advice, and decided he would not
quarrel.</p>

<p>"Well, you know your affairs best, dear. I'm
only an interfering disagreeable old woman,
who knows very little of modern customs and
ways."</p>

<p>He nodded sympathetically, without answering.</p>

<p>"I love and admire Valentia&mdash;in many ways.
She's so pretty, but not a mere doll! And we
women&mdash;even the happiest of us&mdash;have to go
through so much! Does she go through the
housekeeping books herself, dear?" Mrs. Wyburn
inquired, with dangerous sweetness.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't think so."</p>

<p>"Ah! that seems rather a pity. Still, I'm just
to every one, and I will say that she's not extravagant&mdash;but
has so much cleverness that she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>could manage very well on half the allowance
you give her!"</p>

<p>"Is that new&mdash;that china bird?" Romer asked,
getting up to look at a strange, shiny, abnormal-looking
parrot on a twig that adorned the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It seems all right. Rather jolly."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, it's funny you haven't noticed it
before. Considering it's been there all your life,
and you used to play with it when you were
four, it's odd it's escaped your notice. You
played with it when you were four!" she repeated,
growing rather heated.</p>

<p>"Did I though?"</p>

<p>"But things do escape your notice&mdash;that's
just the point. I sometimes wish I didn't see so
much myself."</p>

<p>"So do I," he answered. "May I smoke,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Of course you may, dear. You may do anything
on earth you like. Have some tea? <i>I</i> never have
anything but China tea, so it won't do you any
harm."</p>

<p>"I hate China tea," he answered reflectively,
after what seemed to his mother about half an
hour's deep thought.</p>

<p>... "But what I always have said about
Valentia is that though we all admit, dear,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>that she has charming manners, is bright and
amusing and very sweet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"<i>Outwardly</i>, is there anything behind it all?
Has she any depth?" She quickly answered her
own question, "<i>I</i> think she has; a great deal. I
believe Valentia is extremely clever in her own
way; she turns <i>you</i> round her little finger. But
that wouldn't matter so much&mdash;anything's
better than quarrelling and snapping and finding
fault continually&mdash;which is a thing I hate.
But, really, there's one point I'm quite anxious
about&mdash;in fact, I often lie awake the whole
night&mdash;the entire night&mdash;and wake up in the
morning utterly worn out through thinking
about it, Romer dear. There's nothing like a
mother's heart&mdash;and this does make me anxious,
I own."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, that she should ever be talked about!
That she should be considered a flirt&mdash;and that
sort of thing! I couldn't bear the idea of my
son's wife having her name coupled with that
of any young man&mdash;or any nonsense of that
sort. It would be most painful to me. I'm sure
I ask every one who knows her if anything of
that kind is ever said."</p>

<p>Romer threw away the cigarette and stood
up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>"What infernal rot!" he said, with a heightened
colour.</p>

<p>Her eyes brightened with pleasure. She was
delighted to have irritated him at last out of his
calmness.</p>

<p>"Well, well, perhaps I'm a little over-anxious.
It's all love, all devotion to you, dear.
Of course, people do talk. There's no doubt
about that; but good gracious! we all know
there's nothing in it. Don't we? Don't be cross
with your poor old mother, Romer."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I must be off. Eight on
Thursday, eh?"</p>

<p>She kissed him affectionately, walked with
him to the landing, where she kept him for
about ten minutes complaining of the awful
worry she had had about the under-housemaid,
and of the sickening impossibility of getting a
piano-tuner to attend to the instrument properly
without making any sound.</p>

<p>"For I'm a mass of nerves, my dear. Give my
best love to dear Valentia."</p>

<h3>ROMER</h3>


<p>Romer walked back, trying to throw off the
irritating effect of his mother's pin-pricks.
As was his usual custom when he was a little
depressed, he went home and sat down in front
of his wife's portrait. He often sat there for an
hour when she was out, looking at it. Any one
watching him would have thought he was in a
state of calm and stupid content. In reality, he
was worshipping. His passion for his wife was
his one romance, his one interest, his one
thought. He had been married five years, and
had never yet expressed it in words. He was one
of the unfortunate people who are not gifted
with the power of expression, either in word or
look. He was practically inarticulate.</p>

<p>As he gazed at the picture&mdash;he was feeling a
little sad&mdash;the sadness melted away. The frail
figure, bright yet dim, vaguely appearing
through vaporous curtains, holding an impossible
gold flower, had the effect on him of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>beautiful Madonna on a deeply devout Catholic.
It produced in him a form of religious ecstasy.
He adored her with passion, and with the
selfishness and jealousy of passion, but circumstances
and his temperament caused it to take
the outward form, principally, of care for her
happiness. When she was actually present, she
still dazzled him so much that he could show
his feeling only by listening to and agreeing
with every word she said, by doing what she
asked him, and by trying to protect her, often
without her knowledge, from any kind of pain or
trouble. She would have been amazed had she
realised the violence of his devotion to her.
Apparently cool and matter-of-fact, he was in
reality a reticent fanatic. He neither analysed nor
showed his sentiment, nor did he himself know its
extent. He wondered why certain people, certain
subjects gave him pain. He trusted Valentia
absolutely, nor could she in his eyes do wrong,
and it was only with the subconscious second
sight of love that he sometimes felt a curious
and melancholy presentiment. He did not know
himself that this suffering was jealousy.</p>

<p>What nonsense his mother talked!...</p>

<p>Harry!... Harry was the best fellow in the
world&mdash;almost like a brother, his greatest
friend, though not exactly an intimate friend.
Romer was too shy to be intimate with any one.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Harry was lively, amusing, a brilliant talker;
kind, good-natured, a capital chap. He appreciated
Valentia, or he could not have painted
that portrait. Romer was very grateful for the
portrait; yet it sometimes hurt him to think
Harry had painted it. It showed how well
Harry understood Valentia.</p>

<p>This thought Romer always suppressed. He
thought it was mean, and he could not be mean.</p>

<p>He looked out of the window. It was raining&mdash;a
chilly spring shower&mdash;but there was a stir
in the air, a rattle in the town, a sense of
something that was going to happen; summer
was not far off, and in the summer, at the end
of the season, they would go down to the
Green Gate, the lovely country house with the
dream garden as Valentia called it, all built,
planted, and arranged on purpose for her.
Valentia was more herself at the Green Gate
than anywhere else. Leisure suited her, and roses.</p>

<p>Every year Romer silently counted the weeks
until they went back there. It was where he
was happiest. Of course, they were not alone.
Dear little Daphne was always with them, dear
little thing (she was nearly six feet high)&mdash;and
other people, very often, and Harry&mdash;always
Harry. Perhaps Daphne would marry soon, but
what about Harry?</p>

<p>Romer felt rather wearied when he remembered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Valentia had said Harry was made to be
a bachelor. Was he tired of Harry? Not a bit!
Harry was a capital chap; besides, he didn't see
so very much of him in London.</p>

<p>Heaps of people admired Valentia, and that
did not annoy Romer at all (though it did not
please him particularly), but he knew, again
subconsciously, that Valentia cared less than
nothing for any admirers, but she certainly was
awfully fond of Harry. And no wonder! Harry
was the best fellow in the world&mdash;lively,
amusing, quite a brilliant talker; kind, good
natured, and he appreciated Valentia, or he
could not have painted that portrait....</p>

<p>Round and round the same thoughts passed
through his brain.</p>

<p>It was raining&mdash;a chilly spring shower. Had
Valentia got her wrap with her?</p>

<p>He got up, went into the hall, and saw her
fur cloak hanging on a peg.</p>

<p>She evidently didn't care for it. She was tired
of it&mdash;perhaps it was out of fashion; if so, she
would never wear it. She might catch cold.</p>

<p>He was not a prompt man, but he went at once
to the telephone and gave orders to a shop in Bond
Street that would result in a collection of fur-lined
cloaks being sent for her choice that evening. This
would please her; she would smile and try them
on. Besides, it would prevent her catching cold.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>HARRY'S ENTERTAINMENT</h3>


<p>Van Buren, who was a business man,
was an idealist; while Harry de Freyne,
the artist&mdash;was, emphatically, not.</p>

<p>Van Buren had been brought up on Thackeray
and Dickens, above all on old pictures from
<i>Punch</i>; Du Maurier's drawings enjoyed at an
early age had made him romantic about everything
connected with London. As soon as he
was able to leave his bank in New York&mdash;in
fact, the moment he had retired from business&mdash;he
had realised his dream and come to live
in London. And Harry seemed to him the incarnation
of everything delightfully, amusingly
English. He had a real hero-worship for Harry,
who was so astonishingly clever as well. Van
Buren was not a snobbish Anglomaniac, at least
his snobbishness was not of the common quality
nor about the obvious things; he was a little
ashamed of his money, but he did not worship
rank and titles; it was Intellect&mdash;but Intellect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>that had the stamp of fashion&mdash;that held a
glamour for him. So did everything that he
supposed to be modern, previous, and up-to-date.
No one could ever, whether in New York
or in London, have been in life less modern
than poor Van Buren, though he was eminently
contemporary and perhaps even in
advance in matters connected with business.
For business he had genius, and yet, curiously,
no passion; he was unconsciously brilliant on
the subject; it was hereditary. But in his innermost
heart he believed that it was vulgar to be
an American millionaire! And he had a childish
horror of vulgarity, and an innocent belief that
an Englishman who had been to Eton and
Oxford and who was <i>dans le mouvement</i>, smart
and good-looking, and had deserted diplomacy
for art, must of necessity be refined, superior,
cultured, everything that Van Buren wanted
to be.</p>

<p>Of course he soon found out that Harry was
frightfully hard up, and in the most delicate
manner imaginable&mdash;a delicacy rather wasted
on his friend&mdash;implored, as a special favour,
to be allowed to be his banker. But Harry had
refused, having vague ideas of much more
important extent than a mere loan with regard
to making Van Buren useful. He had thus
gone up in his friend's estimation, at the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>time placing him under a great and deeply felt
obligation by gratifying his fancy for knowing
clever people and celebrities.</p>

<p>At last the friendship had culminated in
Harry's suggestion of a marriage between his
young cousin, Daphne, and Van Buren. Harry
felt that if he could compass this arrangement
he would at one stroke give fortune to Daphne,
freedom to himself&mdash;the child was very much
in his way in Valentia's house&mdash;and make Van
Buren eternally grateful.</p>

<p>Harry really liked Van Buren and respected
him; he regarded him as touching, but also,
at times, as a menace. A shadow sometimes
came over their friendship, the alarming shadow
of the future bore. What was now to his
cynical mind screamingly funny about the
American&mdash;his sensitive delicate feelings, his
high standard of morals with regard to what he
called the ladies, and illusions that one would
rarely find in London in a girl of seventeen,
might some day develop into priggishness and
tediousness, and&mdash;especially&mdash;would take up
too much time. For since Harry had been intimate
with Van Buren he had discovered that
the tradition of American hustling was, like
most traditions, a fiction. Americans always
have time; Englishmen never. The leisurely
way in which Van Buren talked was an example
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>of this&mdash;it was the way he thought; his brain
worked slowly. Harry and his like have no time
to drawl; they have to keep appointments.</p>

<p>On the evening of the Ritz dinner-party
Harry was not in a particularly good temper,
and thought to himself he was rather like a
Barnum as he introduced his guests one by one
to the modest millionaire, who said to them all,
"Pleased to meet you", and fixed his admiring
glance with a sentimental respect on Daphne,
an undisguised admiration on Valentia, and
an almost morbid curiosity on Miss Luscombe,
the first actress he had ever met.</p>

<p>Miss Luscombe was a conventional, rather
untidy-looking creature, very handsome, with
loose hair parted and waved over her ears, and
with apparently no design or general idea
either in her dress or manner. She varied from
minute to minute from being what she thought
theatrical to appearing what she supposed to be
social. She evidently hadn't settled on her pose,
always a disastrous moment for a natural
woman who wishes to be artificial. Practically
she always wore evening dress except in the
evening, so while at her own flat in the afternoon
she was photographed in a <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i> tea-gown,
this evening she was dressed as if for
Ascot, except for the hat, with an emaciated
feather boa and a tired embroidered <i>cr&ecirc;pe de
Chine</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> scarf thrown over her shoulders, also a
fan, long gloves, and a rose in her hair by way
of hedging. To these ornaments she added a
cold, of which she complained as soon as she
saw the other guests. But no one listened. No
one ever listened to Miss Luscombe, no one
ever could, and yet in a way she was popular&mdash;a
kind of pet among a rather large circle of people.
Women never disliked her because she created
no jealousy and always unconsciously put herself
at a disadvantage; men did not mind her
prattle and coquettish airs, being well aware
that nothing was expected of them. For Miss
Luscombe, though vain, was a pessimist, and
quite good-natured. She was also a standing
joke.</p>

<p>The other guests besides Valentia in yellow
and Daphne in pink&mdash;both looking as fresh as
daisies and as civilised as orchids&mdash;consisted of
Lady Walmer, a smart, good-looking, commonplace
woman, rather fatter than she wished to
be, but very straight-fronted, straightforward,
and sporting, with dark red hair and splendid
jewels; a faded yet powerful beauty who had
been admired in the eighties, but had only had
real success since she turned forty-six.</p>

<p>With her was her daughter, a girl who at the
first glance looked eight feet high, but who really
was not very much above the average length.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>She was a splendid athlete, and her talk was
principally of hockey. She wore a very smart
white dress and had a dark brown neck, pretty
fair hair, and an entirely unaffected bonhomie
that quite carried off the harshness of her want
of style or charm&mdash;in fact it had a charm of its
own. Besides, it was well known that her
grandmother had left her an estate in the
country and &pound; 7000 a year, and that Lady
Walmer was anxious to get her married. Hence
Miss Walmer never wanted for partners at balls
nor for attention anywhere, but&mdash;it was always
for <i>le bon motif</i>. As Valentia said, she was the
sort of girl (poor girl!) that one could only marry.</p>

<p>Hereford Vaughan, who was an object of
considerable curiosity to several of the guests on
account of his phenomenal success in having
eleven plays at the same time being performed
in London, New York, Berlin, Paris, and every
other European city, was, to those who did not
know him before, an agreeable surprise. Heaven
knows what exactly people expected of him; perhaps
the men feared 'side' and the women that
he would be overpowering after so many
triumphs, but he was merely a rather pale, dark,
and rather handsome young man. He behaved
like anybody else, except that perhaps his manner
was a little quieter than the average. Unless
one was very observant (which one isn't), or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>unless one listened to what he said, he did
not at first appear too alarmingly clever. He had
one or two characteristics which must have at
times led to misunderstandings. One was that
whatever or whoever he looked at, his dark
opaque eyes were so full of vivid expression that
women often mistook for admiration what was
often merely observation. For instance, when he
glanced at Lady Walmer she at once became
quite confused, and intensely flattered, nearly
blushed and asked him to dinner. While, if she
had but known, behind that dark glance was
merely the thought, "So that's the woman that
Royalty ... What extraordinary taste!"</p>

<p>Hereford Vaughan, who was himself thirty-four,
did not share in the modern taste for the
battered as a charm in itself, though he could
forgive it&mdash;or, indeed, anything else&mdash;if he were
amused.</p>

<p>Knowing that Miss Luscombe, hoping for a
part, would be painfully nice to Vaughan, Harry
had good-naturedly placed them as far apart
as possible. Nevertheless she leaned across the
table and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"How <i>do</i> you think of all these clever things,
Mr. Vaughan? I can't think how you do it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, we'd all like to know that,"
said Captain Foster, the baby Guardsman, as
Valentia called him. He spoke enviously. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>a perfectly beautiful blond, delightfully stupid,
and had been longing for enough money to
marry somebody ever since he was seventeen.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'd jolly soon write a play if I only
knew how."</p>

<p>"It's perfectly easy, really," said Vaughan;
"it's just a knack."</p>

<p>"Is it though?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"How do you get the things taken?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a mere fluke&mdash;a bit of luck," said
Vaughan.</p>

<p>Every one who heard this sighed with relief to
think that was how he regarded it.</p>

<p>Vaughan always used this exaggerated modesty
as an armour against envy, for envy, as
a rule, is of success rather than of merit. No one
would have objected to his talent deserving
recognition&mdash;only to his getting it.</p>

<p>"Now what do you think of Miss Luscombe?"
Valentia asked the dramatist.</p>

<p>"I don't think of her. I never regard people on
the stage as real people," Vaughan answered.</p>

<p>"Don't you, really? Well, you ought to know.
You have made a sort of corner in 'leading
ladies'. What curious clothes she wears!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't she? On the stage she dresses like an
actress, and off the stage she doesn't dress like a
lady. She's so extraordinarily vague," he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>"Yes; and yet I've heard that, though she's
so dreamy and romantic, she's quite wonderfully
practical, really. She never accepts an engagement
unless she gets a large salary&mdash;and all that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I see. She lives in the clouds, but she insists
on their having a silver lining," said Vaughan.
"Who's the pink young man she's confiding in
now?"</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Rathbone. He likes theatres&mdash;at
least he collects programmes and posters, I think.
Besides, he's tattooed."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. That must be a great help in listening
to Miss Luscombe. He's been trained to
suffer."</p>

<p>Miss Luscombe was talking rather loudly and
most confidentially to Rathbone, who had an
expression of willing&mdash;but agonised&mdash;martyrdom
on his fair pink, clean-shaven features.</p>

<p>"I <i>told</i> dear George Alexander that I would
have been only <i>too</i> pleased to understudy Irene
in the new piece&mdash;in fact, it would have just
suited me, Mr. Rathbone, and left me plenty of
time for my social engagements too. Besides, if I
once got a chance of a part like that I feel I should
have made a hit. Oh, it was a cruel disappointment!
After being too charming to me&mdash;or, at
any rate, I was charming to him at the Cashmores'
reception, you know&mdash;I remember he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>was standing in the refreshment-room with Mrs.
Cashmore, and I went <i>straight</i> up to him and
said, 'Don't you remember me, Mr. Alexander?'&mdash;and
after all this he only promised me&mdash;and
that conditionally&mdash;a horrid, silly little part in
the curtain-raiser in No. 2 B Company on tour.
On tour! Of course I refused that&mdash;one must
keep up one's prestige, Mr. Rathbone. There's a
great deal of injustice in the profession. Talent
counts for nothing&mdash;it's all influence. But I've
always had a great ambition ever since I was
a little girl." Miss Luscombe put her head on one
side and talked as she had to the interviewer of
<i>The Perfect Lady</i>. "It was always my dream&mdash;do
you know?&mdash;to marry a great actor&mdash;or, at
any rate, to be his great friend&mdash;like Irving and
Ellen Terry&mdash;that sort of thing&mdash;a great, lifelong
friendship! And as a child I was madly in
love with the elder George Grossmith, but I
don't think he ever knew it. Too bad!"</p>

<p>She pouted childishly, gave her arch musical
laugh with its three soprano notes and upward
inflection, and then accepted a quail with a
heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"When I was a boy," said Rathbone in a low
concentrated voice of reminiscence&mdash;he spoke
rather quickly, for he had been trying in vain
during the whole of dinner to get a word in
edgeways and feared to lose his chance now&mdash;"when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>I was a boy I was in love, too, with some
one on the stage. Between ourselves&mdash;you won't
mention it, will you, Miss Luscombe?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can trust me," she said earnestly, with
a look of Julia Neilson.</p>

<p>"Good! Well, I was in love, and I've got her
initials&mdash;C. L.&mdash;tattooed on me now!"</p>

<p>"Impossible! How exciting! Who is C. L.?"</p>

<p>He looked round the table and murmured in
a low voice, "Cissie Loftus. Isn't it odd? I wrote
and told her about it, but I never received an
answer to my letter."</p>

<p>"Poor, poor boy! I call that really touching!
Will you show me the initials some day?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. Impossible." He was stern, adamantine.
She hastily went on. "So you're very keen&mdash;interested
in the stage, Mr. Rathbone?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the stage door. I collect programmes,
and I haven't missed a first night since I was
twenty!"</p>

<p>"Fancy! Then I ought to remember your face,
at all the theatres!"</p>

<p>"I mean at the Gaiety," he said, "only the
Gaiety."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Gaiety!" she turned her shoulder
to him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Yes, Miss Daphne, if you would come out to
New York you'd have a real good time. You'd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>turn all the young fellow's heads. I'm afraid
you'd do a terrible amount of damage there. I
should like to show you and Mrs. Wyburn Newport
in the season, too. You ladies have it all
your own way over the other side of&mdash;&mdash;may I
say, the herringpond?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please do; yes, <i>do</i> say the herringpond!"</p>

<p>Daphne leant forward and said to Harry:</p>

<p>"Do you know who is that very distinguished-looking
man who has just come in&mdash;rather
weary and a little grey on the temples? He
bowed and kissed the woman's hand so charmingly&mdash;at
the next table to us. Looks like a great
diplomatist."</p>

<p>"Then he must be a stockbroker," said
Valentia decidedly. "Every one with the grand
manner always is."</p>

<p>"Really! I can't say; I don't know any stockbrokers,"
said Miss Luscombe.</p>

<p>"How distinguished that sounds!" murmured
Vaughan.</p>

<p>"It's very clever of you, Miss Luscombe,"
said Lady Walmer; "I don't see how you can
help it! I know nobody else. I always tell Alec
she'll have to marry one, and when she says she
doesn't want to, 'My dear child,' I say, 'you
can't marry people you don't see!' And almost
the only people she ever sees at our house <i>are</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>stockbrokers&mdash;except a few soldiers who never
have a penny."</p>

<p>Alec was the daughter, named after her distinguished
godmother.</p>

<p>"It's quite gone out to be snobbish now," Lady
Walmer continued in a lower voice to Harry.
"We're all only too glad to take all we can get
in exchange for anything we give!"</p>

<p>"And you don't call that snobbish?" said
Harry.</p>

<p>"My dear, no!&mdash;of course, we give as little as
possible. I talk like this and yet I married for
love&mdash;and you know the result! Walmer's always
gambling, always running after&mdash;goodness
knows what&mdash;and leaves me&mdash;not quite in
the gutter, but certainly on the kerb!"</p>

<p>"Don't you want Alec to marry for love?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she'll have to, my dear&mdash;she's
not very attractive. It's a blessing she's an
heiress. But if she's allowed to play hockey, and
skate, and fence, and dance, and the husband is
fairly kind to her, I'm sure she'll be happy&mdash;I
mean, I have no idea of her marrying a duke,
Harry. I shall be satisfied if he's a charming man,
and not too selfish." She lowered her voice still
more to add&mdash;"You know she likes you, poor
child, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You're making fun of me, dear Lady
Walmer."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>"No, I'm not.... Walmer's taken 'Flying
Fish' again, and after Cowes we're going for a
long cruise. You must come with us. Her father
will be all right. He lets me have my own way
about her. Well, aren't you coming?"</p>

<p>"You're too frightfully kind, Lady Walmer,
of course. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear boy, of course you're going to the
Green Gate, but I wish you'd listen to a woman
of the world. That," she gave Valentia a piercing
glance, "can't go on for ever! You will find
Romer making a row some day, and that will be
a bore for you. He's just the sort of man who
would."</p>

<p>Valentia, noticing their confidential tone and
feeling instinctively that some treachery was
in the air, looked once angrily at Harry and then
became apparently absorbed in the conversation
of Vaughan.</p>

<p>Every one was talking volubly and gaily.
Only Daphne and Captain Foster were silent as
they sat side by side looking at their plates. But
they were the only people who had found the
dinner a real success.</p>

<p>Harry, who with all his <i>usage du monde</i> was
peculiarly subject to sudden obscure impulses
as of the primitive man, became pale with a
strange and painful sensation as he looked at
Valentia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>She was flirting with Vaughan, or so every
one present must be thinking. Of course it was
only from pique, and he would soon put a stop
to it.</p>

<p>And Vaughan, with his ironical glance and
quiet manner, why did he look into her eyes
all the time?</p>

<p>What was he saying?</p>

<p>Harry asked them all to come back to the
studio for some music, but even as he made
the arrangement to drive Valentia, he remembered
that, <i>&agrave; la fin des fins</i>, he would have to
leave her at her husband's house. Would
Romer be sitting up? What an ass he was! What
rot the whole dinner was! It was all through
Van Buren. Van Buren was a fool. Confound
Romer!</p>

<p>Harry was jealous.</p>

<h3>DAPHNE</h3>


<p>"More flowers from Van Buren? Let me
look at them. A spray of lilies of the
valley; how touching! He expects you to wear
them at the opera. I think it's <i>such</i> a mistake to
wear real flowers on an evening dress. They
have a damp, chilly look, like fresh vegetables,
at first, and when they begin to fade they make
you look faded, too. Never mind, Daphne; I
think perhaps you'd better wear them just to-night,"
said Valentia.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," said Daphne, "he sent me that
basket of American Beauty roses. The day before
he sent me Ella Wheeler Wilcox's poems."</p>

<p>Valentia smiled. "Poor darling!&mdash;I mean Van
Buren's a poor darling, not you. You see, he's
got the nice sort of Boston idea that a man ought
only to send a girl flowers or books, or music.
He thinks it's respectful. But, anyway, it's a very
good sign."</p>

<p>"A good sign? But I thought there was so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>much of that sort of thing&mdash;I mean fuss and
attention, to girls in America. I thought that
didn't mean anything. I mean anything particular."</p>

<p>"Daphne, dear, don't blind yourself; don't
shut your eyes to obvious facts. It isn't a matter
of what you think or what I think, or of speculation
at all. I <i>happen to know</i> that Van Buren <i>is</i>
going to propose to you. He'll probably do it at
Henley or at Sandown, or in the Park. He's
certain to want it to be on a typically English
background; but you can take it from me, for a
dead cert, that it's bound to come."</p>

<p>Daphne sat down and looked serious.</p>

<p>"Valentia, it's no good. Don't let him do it.
It will be so frightfully uncomfortable meeting
him afterwards."</p>

<p>"Frightfully uncomfortable meeting the man
to whom you're engaged? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I shan't be engaged to him."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I shall never marry, Valentia."</p>

<p>Valentia stared at her in silence.</p>

<p>"What is your idea, darling? Why, you won't
be eighteen till June. You can't be sure you'll
never want to marry!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care for Van Buren."</p>

<p>"I thought you liked him so much?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>"Well, he seems all right at first. But I
simply couldn't stand him always about."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you? Poor pet! But he mightn't <i>be</i>
always about."</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't stand his marked attention.
Valentia, I <i>hate</i> marked attention."</p>

<p>"Do you, really? Who'd have thought it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and he'd always be so considerate
and so thoughtful and so respectful!"</p>

<p>"That mightn't last when you were married,"
said Valentia consolingly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he might not be so bad after we were
once married.... But I shouldn't like to risk it.
And the engagement! Oh! I couldn't simply
<i>stand</i> the engagement! Just think of the ring,
and the sentiment, and the fuss, and the letters!
Oh, he'd enjoy it all so much! Oh, it would make
me simply sick to see how pleased he'd be!"</p>

<p>"I know that feeling," said Valentia sympathetically,
nodding her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, and don't you see how he'd think he was
engaged to a well-brought-up, nice English girl
who was a relation of Harry's, and knew all the
right people, and all that sort of thing? And
he'd take a big house&mdash;he's hinted this to me
already&mdash;most likely in Park Lane&mdash;anyhow,
something just like a millionaire in a book. It's
all so dull, and cut-and-dried."</p>

<p>"Some of these cut-and-dried obvious things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>turn out quite jolly afterwards. It's the uncomfortable,
romantic things that are more often
failures. And you know, Daphne, you do like
pretty things and clothes, and going everywhere,
and&mdash;not only that, he's really such a dear, and
a good sort, and so good-looking! And you'd put
me into a very awkward position with Harry if
you refuse him. But, of course, darling, you
must do as you like."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Valentia, don't <i>let</i> me refuse
him. I don't want to. Don't let it come to that.
I'm sure I should loathe to hear him propose."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It would make me sick."</p>

<p>"What can I tell Harry really as your reason
for not being able to stand Van?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure <i>I</i> don't know!"</p>

<p>"He bores you," announced Valentia. "That's
what's the matter. He doesn't amuse you."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, it isn't that!" cried Daphne
vehemently. "I don't <i>want</i> to be amused. Do
you think I like a man because he's clever, or
funny, and always making jokes? That bores me
frightfully. Harry's way of being lively and
clever bores me to <i>death</i>! I don't want to marry
a professional entertainer! No, Valentia, that's
more the sort of thing you'd like. <i>You're</i> quite
sorry Romer's not like that."</p>

<p>"I don't suggest that it would be ideal to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>marry Harry Lauder, Daphne dear. But wouldn't
you really like someone fairly intelligent?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should I? Do you think I want to
marry a man so horribly clever that he wouldn't
understand a word I said?"</p>

<p>"Let's have it out, dear. What do you think
you want?" Valentia answered herself; "It's
Foster, of course! That dull, empty-headed,
commonplace, hard-up, handsome boy. You
can't marry him. He's just twenty-two, and has
only a miserable allowance, and is in an expensive
regiment, and you, darling, will only have three
hundred a year. I should love to see you happy
in your own way and having your wish, but
don't you think it's a childish fancy? You're
both children. Of course he hasn't suggested
marriage, yet, has he? He knows perfectly well
it's out of the question."</p>

<p>"Valentia! Darling! Why, he proposed to me
the day we were introduced&mdash;at Prince's, and
he's been doing it ever since."</p>

<p>"Oh, how utterly absurd of him! Well, anyhow,
you must wait and see. Even if he could
afford it, I don't think it would be a success.
Why, there's nothing in the boy! What do you
see in him?"</p>

<p>"I like the way he laughs," said Daphne,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me one thing straight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>out? I'm being very nice to you about this, dear.
I ought to scold you. But, at any rate, you must
treat me with complete confidence."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course, dear."</p>

<p>"Tell me, he hasn't ever kissed you, has he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Valentia!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, darling. I felt sure he
hadn't."</p>

<p>"Of course he has."</p>

<p>"He has!&mdash;Where?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, where? Oh! at every
dance where we've ever met. He always does,
whenever he can. Is it so dreadful? He's such a
boy!"</p>

<p>"Fancy your liking him enough for that!"
said Valentia, stupefied.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a darling; and the only person I
ever could possibly marry."</p>

<p>"It's rather serious," said Valentia; "and
poor Van who is so devoted!"</p>

<p>"He isn't, really," said Daphne decidedly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so? Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the whole thing's an <i>idea</i>&mdash;the sort of
thing he <i>wants to do</i>. It's not genuine."</p>

<p>"I should have thought the feelings of a man
of thirty-four who could marry any one he chose
would be more real than the fancy of a mere
boy! Boys like anybody."</p>

<p>"Van isn't genuine like Cyril," said Daphne.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>"Who on earth's Cyril?"</p>

<p>"Captain Foster."</p>

<p>Valentia walked round the room and then
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you really suppose you're going to adore
him all your life?"</p>

<p>"I <i>suppose</i> so. I really don't know. I know
about now. Oh, Valentia, be a darling and let
him come to the fancy ball with us." She kissed
her. "And, oh, do tell Harry to explain to Van
that it can't go on, that he must put it out of his
head. Do, darling Valentia. Any well-brought-up
young girl will do for him just as well!"</p>

<p>"And wouldn't any well-brought-up young
girl do for Cyril?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But only Cyril will do for me.
Oh! the jolly way he has of saying 'Righto' and
'You're all right,' and calling me 'little girl!'
Oh, he <i>is</i> a dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if he says such brilliant things as
<i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>"It isn't what he <i>says</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Daphne, here is Romer. I shan't
tell him a word about it. Well, I'll think it
over." She called Daphne back and said in a
half-hearted way&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose it wouldn't do just to sort of please
Harry by marrying Van, and then seeing that
silly boy now and then. You'd so soon get tired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>of him&mdash;but, no! that wouldn't be right. Forget
that I said it&mdash;I don't mean it."</p>

<p>"I couldn't stand Van at all," said Daphne
definitely, "whether I saw Cyril or not."</p>

<p>"Then you shan't be bothered with him. But
can't you give up Cyril? I know I'm right about
it. It isn't only the hard-upness and the impossibility&mdash;of
course, I know he's got relations
and all that&mdash;but, it's he himself. You'll get
bored with him, too, in a different way."</p>

<p>"I like him so much <i>now</i>," pleaded Daphne.</p>

<p>Romer came in and Valentia merely told him
at great length every word of the foregoing
conversation with lavish comments by herself.
Secretly Romer was bitterly disappointed when
he realised that the possibility of his being left
alone with his wife was more remote, but of
course he agreed with Valentia, as she changed
her mind a dozen times on the subject, and as
usual the conversation ended in a telephone
message to Harry to come round at once.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>IN FANCY DRESS</h3>


<p>Van Buren had had many pleasures,
many gratifications since he had been in
London; his dreams&mdash;the dreams inspired by
Du Maurier's drawings when he was a little
boy&mdash;had been very nearly realised. Perhaps the
greatest triumph that he had had yet was the
evening of the Artists' Fancy Ball.</p>

<p>He had succeeded in making up a party to go
in costume. He was always making up parties,
and he had for many years been obsessed by a
longing to dress up.</p>

<p>Harry, in mockery of his passion for everything
English, had advised him to go as an
Ancient Briton, with a coat of blue paint. Scorning
such ribald chaff, he had ordered a magnificent
costume of chain armour. Greatly to his
satisfaction he had persuaded Hereford Vaughan
to go as Shakespeare, Valentia and Daphne
respectively as Portia in scarlet and Rosalind in
green.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>A large party were to dine at Van Buren's
rooms before the ball. Fancy dress has the effect
of bringing out odd, unexpected little characteristics
in people. For example, Harry, good-looking
and a dandy, quite a romantic type,
hated dressing up, and cared nothing whatever
about his costume; while Romer, the sober and
serious, enjoyed it immensely, and appeared to
think his appearance of the utmost importance&mdash;almost
a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>The women were far less self-conscious in
costume than the men, and cared far less how
they looked, probably because women are always
more or less in fancy dress, and it was not so
much of a novelty to them.</p>

<p>Valentia had pointed out that Shakespeare, to
be quite correct, should wear ear-rings; so
Vaughan called at her house on the way to Van
Buren's, as she had promised to lend him some.</p>

<p>"He won't know how to put them on," said
Daphne, drawing on her long boots. "Probably
he hasn't had his ears pierced; you must go and
screw them on for him."</p>

<p>Valentia ran down. Just as she was screwing
the long coral and pearl ear-rings with rather
painful energy on to the unfortunate young man's
ears, the servant, with a slight expression of
terror that could not be concealed, announced&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wyburn."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>The situation was really rather comic. Romer's
mother, who was going to a dinner-party in the
same street, could not forgo the pleasure of
calling unexpectedly on them at half-past seven,
vaguely hoping that it might be inconvenient to
them, and that she would catch them in something
they didn't want her to know&mdash;a true
mother's instinct. But not in her wildest dreams
had she expected what she saw when she entered
the drawing-room&mdash;her daughter-in-law in her
red mortar-board, red cloak and bands, with,
apparently, her arms round the neck of a young
man in purple silk stockings and jewelled embroidered
gloves with rings outside them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn literally sank into a chair.</p>

<p>Valentia was perfectly equal to the occasion.
She thoroughly enjoyed the baffling of Mrs.
Wyburn.</p>

<p>"I can't think why Romer didn't tell you,"
she repeated several times, "that Van Buren is
giving a dinner for the fancy ball!" and she rang
and gave orders that her husband and sister were
to come down immediately.</p>

<p>Romer had been four hours dressing; Daphne
about ten minutes.</p>

<p>"I do think you ought to have a little make-up.
Will you?" said Valentia to Vaughan.</p>

<p>"I should love to," he answered, to Mrs.
Wyburn's disgust and horror, looking in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>glass and taking very little notice of the indignant old lady.</p>

<p>"He <i>does</i> need just a touch of lip-salve and a
little black under the eyes, don't you think so?"
Valentia asked, caressingly, pretending to consult
Mrs. Wyburn.</p>

<p>"I can't say, I'm sure. I've no idea what he
wants," said Mrs. Wyburn with a snap.</p>

<p>"But don't you think it would improve him,
darling?" Valentia went on, holding her head on
one side and holding up her hand as if she were
looking at a picture.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mrs. Wyburn.</p>

<p>"Then do you think his lips are red enough
already?" asked Valentia.</p>

<p>Vaughan hastily interrupted the absurd discussion.</p>

<p>"The human lip is never red enough," he
said decidedly; "they ought to be bright, light
scarlet."</p>

<p>"That's just what I think. I've got some
lovely scarlet stuff&mdash;the colour of sealing-wax.
Shall I fetch it for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do," he said.</p>

<p>"But won't it look rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; merely decent," said the young man decidedly.</p>

<p>"And what does Romer say to <i>all this</i>?" said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Mrs. Wyburn with a forced smile and a voice
trembling with uncontrollable rage.</p>

<p>"Oh, he likes it, darling. He loves it. No one's
been so keen about their dress as Romer. I'll go
and fetch him, and my roll of parchment&mdash;I had
forgotten my roll of parchment."</p>

<p>She ran upstairs and came down saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Romer won't be a minute, dear; he's awfully
anxious for you to see his dress. He's just darkening
his eyelashes. That's all. He's Louis XIX or
something, you know."</p>

<p>She then deliberately and openly drew Vaughan
to the window where there was still bright June
daylight and painted his lips a brilliant scarlet
to their mutual satisfaction and Mrs. Wyburn's
unspeakable horror.</p>

<p>"Mad," murmured Mrs. Wyburn, half to
herself, "quite mad! I shall be quite upset for
the Trott-Hellyers' dinner-party. It's Dr. Trott-Hellyers'
birthday. He only <i>lives</i> three doors
from you" (she said this rather reproachfully),
"and I dine with him <i>every</i> year on his birthday!
And to think I only came in to see my son for a
minute or two, because I couldn't bear to pass
his door ... his very door...."</p>

<p>"Sweet of you," said Valentia.</p>

<p>... "And then to think I should find&mdash;&mdash;" She
screamed suddenly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Daphne had come in, in her green cloak,
doublet and hose, and little green cap, Romer in
paint and powder, patches and lace ruffles,
sword and snuffbox. There was a lavish amount
of rouge on his cheeks and his eyes were blacked
almost to the temples.</p>

<p>Hearing that his mother was there he had
finished the left eye rather hurriedly, the result
being that he looked as if he had been fighting.</p>

<p>While the poor lady was trying to adjust herself
to this sight, and explaining for the sixth
time why she was there, and making bitter
remarks about a young girl going to a ball in
what she (Mrs. Wyburn) called trousers, and
while Daphne kept on wrapping herself in the
folds of her cloak and then undoing them again
to show her nice high boots, she was still more
distressed at the arrival of her <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> and
mortal enemy, Harry de Freyne.</p>

<p>Van Buren had sent his motor for them, containing
Harry.</p>

<p>Had his name not been announced by the servant,
Mrs. Wyburn would certainly not have recognised
Harry. He was a pierrot in white satin,
with a violet tulle ruffle round his neck and a
black velvet mask. One would know him solely
by his single eye-glass, his pleasant voice, and
fluent conversation.</p>

<p>Pretending to be a clown he jumped in,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>bowed low to Mrs. Wyburn, and kissed first
Daphne and then Valentia.</p>

<p>With a last-straw expression Mrs. Wyburn
drew herself up to her full height.</p>

<p>"Give me my cloak, Romer. I must go. No,
don't come to the carriage with me. Suppose the
Trott-Hellyers were to see you&mdash;they'd never
get over it!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's all right, mother," Romer answered.
"I'm all right. I'm a courtier&mdash;of the
tenth century&mdash;you know. I'm all right."</p>

<p>"And you approve of your young sister-in-law
going to a public ball dressed up as a man?"</p>

<p>"Rosalind wasn't a man, mother. You forget;
you must read the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>
again. You've forgotten it."</p>

<p>"I shan't find Rosalind there. But that's not
the point. When I came in I found Valentia with
that man&mdash;the man who writes in purple
knickerbockers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't&mdash;he never writes in purple
knickerbockers."</p>

<p>"Is this meant to be witty?" she asked with a
freezing glare.</p>

<p>"What? No, I shouldn't think so."</p>

<p>"I found <i>your wife</i>," she said in a low hissing
voice, as they passed through the hall where
there was a large looking-glass&mdash;Romer's attention
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>wandered&mdash;"within an inch of that young
man's face, putting ear-rings in his ears!"</p>

<p>"Well, she couldn't put them in a mile off,"
said Romer absently.</p>

<p>He was now frankly turning his back on his
mother, and staring at his face in the glass.</p>

<p>"Hang it all! I don't look so bad, do I?"</p>

<p>"You look a gentleman," she answered coldly;
"any son of mine must look a gentleman. Of
course, you look ridiculous&mdash;and, as far as that
goes, you <i>are</i> ridiculous; but that doesn't matter
quite so much as long as you look a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot!"</p>

<p>Romer was trying to move a patch from one
corner of his eye to the other.</p>

<p>"But as to Harry de Freyne?... And shall
you allow your wife to dance with him in that
costume?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;why not? And&mdash;<i>doesn't</i> Valentia
look&mdash;jolly?"</p>

<p>"I think the scarlet with her golden hair is
rather too&mdash;striking," she answered spitefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>she's</i> all right!"</p>

<p>"I think you're all mad!" she answered as she
reached the door.</p>

<p>The servant opened it.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're all right. Good night, mother.
You'll be late for the Trott-Hellyers."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Drawing her cloak over her narrow shoulders,
Mrs. Wyburn stepped angrily into the brougham.</p>

<p>Although it was only three doors from her
son's house, she would not for the world have
walked.</p>

<p>When she arrived there, still in a very bad
temper at all she had seen, she nevertheless
boasted to her neighbour about how remarkably
distinguished and handsome her son and
daughter-in-law had looked in costume, and of
their success, charm, perfect domestic happiness,
and importance and perfection generally.</p>

<p>She succeeded in depressing the fossils on
both sides of her, but they smiled at each other,
indulgent to the feminine weakness of so amiable
and devoted a mother.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A CELEBRITY AT HOME</h3>


<p>Miss Luscombe lived with her mother
in a species of tank, or rather in a flat
that gave that impression because it was in the
basement. It was dark, and such glimpses as they
had of people passing on the pavement were
extremely odd; it seemed a procession of legs
and skirts, like something in a pantomime or a
cinematograph.</p>

<p>The Luscombes lived, as it were, beneath the
surface; but that did not prevent their being very
much <i>dans le mouvement</i>, and coming up with
great frequency to the surface to breathe. And
when one had once walked down the steps and
found one's way into the tank, it was an extremely
pleasant one, and quite artistic. It seemed
original, too. There was something almost
freakish in being answered by the parlourmaid
(who was suitably like a fish in manner and
profile), "Miss Luscombe is at home, and will
you please step downstairs?" when one had rung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>the bell on the ground floor. And Miss Luscombe's
ringing laugh with its three soprano notes and
upward cadence always greeted one charmingly
and cordially, and one always liked her; one
couldn't help it. Her great fault was that she
was never alone. She existed in an atmosphere
of teaparties and 'afternoons'; like the Lotus-Eaters,
she lived in 'that land where it was
always afternoon'.</p>

<p>For an obscure person she led a singularly
public life. In her existence there seemed no
secrets, no shadows, no contrasts, and no domesticity.
One could never imagine her except in
what she regarded as full dress, nor without, by
her side, a perpetual bamboo table with three
little shelves in it, in which were distributed
small cut pieces of very yellow cake with very
black currants, sandwiches, made of rather
warm thin bread and butter, pink and white
cocoanut biscuits, and constant relays of strong
dark tea made in a drab china teapot. On
crowded afternoons&mdash;in fact, every other Thursday&mdash;little
coffee cups containing lumpy iced
coffee were also handed round. When they had
music there were lemonade, mustard and cress
sandwiches, and a buffet.</p>

<p>Even when Miss Luscombe was entirely alone
she did not seem so. She had got into the habit
of talking always as if she were surrounded by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>crowds, and said so much about the celebrities
who ought to have turned up that one felt
almost as depressed as if they had really been
there. Sometimes they came, for there was no
one like Miss Luscombe for firmness. Also, she
was never offended and was hospitality itself,
and she had a way of greeting one that was a
reward for all one's trouble&mdash;it seemed much
more trouble than it really was, somehow, just
to step down into the tank. And she was so
charming no one could help being flattered till
the next visitor arrived, when she was even
more charming.</p>

<p>After the Fancy Ball she had got hold of
Valentia, who came to see her on one of those
Thursdays that she had pointed out as peculiarly
her own&mdash;one of <i>my</i> Thursdays. She really
believed that for any one else to receive on that
day was a kind of infringement of copyright.</p>

<p>Miss Luscombe was wearing on this occasion
a drab taffeta silk dress with transparent sleeves
and a low neck. She wore a rose in her hair, a
necklace, and long gloves, because she said she
wouldn't have time to dress again before going
out to dinner.</p>

<p>About a dozen people were there&mdash;vague
shamefaced young men with nothing to say, and
confident, satirical, fluent young men with a
great deal to laugh at. Most of the older women
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>seemed a shade patronising in tone, and looked
as if they had never been there before. On the
faces of the young women and the girls could be
read the resolution never to go there again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luscombe, the mother, was so refined
that there was scarcely anything of her; her
presence was barely perceptible. She had learnt
the art of self-effacement to the point of showing
no trace of being there at all. To add to the
effect of not being noticeable, she wore a dress
exactly the same colour as the sofa on which she
sat&mdash;like those insects who, when hiding from
their foes, become the colour of the leaves on
which they live. She was practically invisible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Miss Luscombe herself
was very much there&mdash;very much <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>.
Smiling, greeting, archly laughing, sweetly
pouting; coquetting, eating, playing, singing,
acting&mdash;almost dancing&mdash;an ideal and delightful
hostess.</p>

<p>She said to every one as they arrived how
sweet it was of them to come so early, or how
naughty it was of them to come so late, or how
horrid it was of them not to come last time, or
how dear it would be of them if they came next.
She always introduced people to each other who
were not on speaking terms, and had intentionally
cut each other for years. She had a real
genius for making people accidentally meet who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>had just broken off their engagement, or had
some other awkward reason for not wishing to
see each other&mdash;and then pushing them together
so that they could not get away. At
heart she was intensely a peacemaker, but
people who had met there rarely made up
their quarrels.</p>

<p>When the favourite actor arrived she introduced
him to every one till he was ready to
drop, and when the great singer telegraphed he
couldn't come, she showed the wire to everybody.
Most of the guests preferred his not
coming. Very few could have endured her
triumph had he really arrived. On the other
hand, they would themselves have far preferred
to receive a telegram of refusal rather than not
to hear from him at all.</p>

<p>When these entertainments were over and
the mother and daughter were left alone, the
daughter became far more thoroughly artificial
than she was when surrounded by her friends.
There was no throwing off the mask; on the
contrary, it was fixed more firmly on, and Miss
Luscombe gave free vent to her sham passion
for imitation comedy.</p>

<p>On this particular Thursday, as soon as
Flora Luscombe had laughed her last visitor
archly to the door, she knelt by her mother's
side, put her arms round her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>"Dear, dear Mummy, how sweet it is to be
alone!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Luscombe shrank back a little. This pet
name, only too appropriate, always got a little
on her nerves, but she felt bound to play up in an
amateurish sort of way to a certain extent.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better go and take off that
beautiful dress?" she said. "You're not really
dining out, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, dearest, I managed to get out of it, but
alas! I've got to go to the Reception&mdash;you know&mdash;that
horrid Royal Institution of Water
Colours&mdash;afterwards. It isn't worth while to
change again. Oh, how weary one does get of
the continual round! And then to-morrow!"
She sighed.</p>

<p>"What is it to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow! Don't talk of it! There's Mrs.
Morris's At Home in Maida Hill, and then
right at the other end of London the Hyslop-Dunn's
in Victoria Grove. Oh, dear! And yet
one feels one must be <i>seen</i> at all these places,
darling, or else it's remarked at once."</p>

<p>"You live too much for the world," replied
her mother, tidying up some half-finished
watercress sandwiches with a sharp knife. She
wondered if, thus repaired, they would do for
next Thursday.</p>

<p>"You know, Mummy dear, that's the worst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>of our terrible profession. We must keep before
the public, or else we drop out and are forgotten.
What a sweet creature Valentia Wyburn is! I
thought she was quite, quite dear. And the
husband and the cousin are darlings too. Of
course they wouldn't come; I couldn't get them
to an afternoon."</p>

<p>She got up and looked in the glass.</p>

<p>"What a crowd there was to-day! Three
people came up to the front door at the same
time. I think they enjoyed themselves, don't
you? Though I feel I can't pay every one proper
attention when there's such a crush, but I do
my little best.... Mr. Simpson came up to
me and told me I looked quite wonderful. But
he's a silly thing." She pouted and put her head
on one side. "Did I look too hideous, darling?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful, of course. The only thing is ..."</p>

<p>Miss Luscombe clapped her hands and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Did its little girlie really look as nice as all
that? Oh, Mummy, Mummy!"</p>

<p>"Charming, dear, I only wish that ..."</p>

<p>"It's too proud of its little daughter, that's
what it is," said Miss Luscombe, sitting on the
arm of her mother's chair. "It's a silly, vain,
conceited mother, that it is. It can't see any
fault in its pet."</p>

<p>She tried to pat her mother's cheek. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Luscombe moved aside with justifiable irritation.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Flora! Yes, dear, of course, I
think you're wonderful, and looked sweet to-day;
but I do wish ..."</p>

<p>"No, no, it doesn't want anything," said Flora.</p>

<p>"I should be so pleased&mdash;if you'd put on just
a little less lip-salve and not quite so much of
that bluish powder."</p>

<p>Having succeeded in completing her sentence,
her mother got up and faded quickly out of the
room and shut the door, leaving Flora looking
quite surprised and rather upset with being
found fault with.</p>

<p>Indeed, she did not quite recover her equanimity
until she had looked over the cards in the
hall and put on a great deal more powder and
lip-salve, after which she told her mother
perhaps she was right, and in any case she,
Flora, would always do what she asked, and
would always follow her dear, dear Mummy's
advice.</p>

<p>She was so charming and amiable that Mrs.
Luscombe pretended to believe her, and said it
was <i>sweet</i> of her to take it all off and go out
that evening without any adventitious aids to
beauty; and this she said in spite of the obvious
fact that Flora had evidently put on considerably
more than usual.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>MISCHIEF</h3>


<p>The elder Mrs. Wyburn was seated at the
gloomy window of her sulky-looking house
in Curzon Street one bright day in the season,
looking out with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Of course she's late; but if that woman
doesn't come I'll never forgive her. She's a silly
fool, but at least she does hear what's going on,"
she reflected.</p>

<p>At this moment an old-fashioned-looking
victoria drove up, drawn by two large grey
horses. In it sat a rather fat and important-looking
lady, with greyish red hair, a straight
decided mouth, and several firm chins. Her
most marked characteristic was her intense
decision on trivialities. She was always curiously
definite on the vaguest of subjects, and extraordinarily
firm and sensible about nothing
in particular.</p>

<p>Miss Westbury was a rich unmarried woman,
with a peculiarly matronly appearance, a good-natured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>love of giving advice, and with views
that obviously dated&mdash;one did not know exactly
from when. If she had some of the Victorian
severities of the sixties, she had also many of
the sentimental vagaries of the eighties. The
serious business of her life was gossip. In her
lighter moments she collected autographs. But
her gossip differed from that of the nervous,
impatient Mrs. Wyburn in that it was far more
pompous and moral, and not nearly so spiteful
and accurate.</p>

<p>Miss Westbury sailed in&mdash;I need hardly say
she was dressed in heliotrope&mdash;and sat down
rather seriously in a large&mdash;and the only comfortable&mdash;armchair.</p>

<p>"My dear Millie, how extremely good of you
to come!" exclaimed Mrs. Wyburn.</p>

<p>Miss Westbury had been christened Maria,
but Millie was the name which she had chosen
to be called by her friends.</p>

<p>"I am very pleased to come, dear Isabella.
To call on you on one of your Wednesdays is, I
know, quite hopeless if one has anything to
say. To call on any one on a day at home, except
as a mere matter of form, I do not consider
sensible."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Will you have some tea?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn rang the bell rather fretfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>She did not care for Millie's made conversation,
and hated her way of gaining time.</p>

<p>"I will have what I always have, dear Mrs.
Wyburn, at five o'clock, if I may&mdash;hot water
with one teaspoonful of milk, and a saccharine
tablet which I bring with me. I am not a faddist,
and I think all those sort of fancies about what
is and what is not good for one are exceedingly
foolish; but when I go in for a r&eacute;gime, dear,
I give it a fair chance. Otherwise there is no
sense in it!"</p>

<p>She settled herself still more sensibly and
decidedly in her chair.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Mrs. Wyburn nervously&mdash;one
could see she was not listening, and thought
Miss Westbury was merely drivelling on&mdash;"whether
you will come to the point at once?
It would be a great comfort if you would. I
have been feeling quite anxious about your
visit. I rather foolishly took some coffee after
lunch, and it kept me awake the whole afternoon&mdash;either
that, or my anxiety."</p>

<p>"If you take coffee after lunch," replied Miss
Westbury, "you should take it made as I do.
Two teaspoonfuls of coffee in a large breakfast-cup
full of hot water, a saccharine tablet, and a
teaspoonful of condensed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was it you really heard, Millie dear,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>about my daughter-in-law?" interrupted Mrs.
Wyburn sharply.</p>

<p>Here the footman brought in the tea. Miss
Westbury frowned, and ostentatiously changed
the subject.</p>

<p>"Have you been to the Grafton? I was persuaded
to go. I think, myself, there's a great
deal too much fuss made about pictures nowadays.
When one thinks of the money that's
wasted on them, when it might be sent to a
hospital, it makes one's blood boil! And some
of those that are made the most fuss about&mdash;both
the Old Masters and the very new ones&mdash;these
post-men, or whatever they're called&mdash;seem
to me perfect nonsense. A daub and a
splash&mdash;no real trouble taken&mdash;and then you're
expected to rave about it. There's one man&mdash;some
one wants me to buy a picture of his&mdash;he
paints all his pictures in tiny squares of different
colours; when you're close you can't see anything,
but it seems that if you walk five feet
away it forms into a kind of pattern. It seems
it's the tessellated school, and they tell me that
in a few years nothing else will count. And what
I thought was a mountain in a mist turns out
to be 'A Nun with cows grazing.' Silly nonsense
I call it!"</p>

<p>"Was the nun grazing, or the cows?" asked
Mrs. Wyburn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>"Goodness knows, dear. Then there was that
other one called Waning Day, or something.
Two people in a boat sailing on dry land! Then
that picture of a purple man with a green
beard! Oh, my dear! The people who took me
there told me it was full of&mdash;something French&mdash;<i>essayage</i>,
or <i>mouvement</i>, I think. The man
who tried to make me buy it said it was symbolical.
But of course I refused. You know I
never have anything to do with nonsense. Well
now, my dear&mdash;&mdash;" Taking pity on Mrs.
Wyburn's extreme impatience, Miss Westbury
came a little nearer. "What I heard was simply
this. My cousin, Jane Totness, took her little
boy, who is in London for the holidays, to the
British Museum. She always likes to improve
his mind as much as possible; besides, he had
been promised a treat after having a tooth out;
the first week of the holidays he always has
a tooth out and a treat after. Jane is like that;
she's a sensible woman, and I must say I think
she brings her boys up very well. I myself might
have been more inclined to take him to Madame
Tussaud's, or even to a matin&eacute;e, or to have an
ice at Buzzard's; but I dare say I'm old-fashioned
enough in some ways, and Jane knows her own
business best."</p>

<p>"No doubt she does," said Mrs. Wyburn,
quivering with impatience, tapping her foot on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>the floor, and trying to restrain herself. "And
so she took the little boy&mdash;Charlie, isn't it?&mdash;to
the British Museum? Go on, dear!"</p>

<p>"Not Charlie, Mrs. Wyburn. It was little
Laurence&mdash;little Laurence. He was called
Laurence after his grandfather, Lord Dorking.
It's the rule in the Totness family; the second
son is always called after the grandfather, the
eldest son after his father, and the third son&mdash;I
mean, of course, if there is one&mdash;after the
mother's father. Don't you think it's a very
sensible plan, dear?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn gave her friend first a sympathetic
smile, and then a murderous glance.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Well, she was just pointing out
something to little Laurence&mdash;he's an intelligent
boy, and I dare say he was enjoying it
very much&mdash;when, to her great surprise, <i>who</i>
should she see but Mrs. Romer Wyburn, talking
away like anything on a seat with&mdash;who do
you think?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"That young man Harry de Freyne&mdash;her
cousin, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!" exclaimed Mrs. Wyburn.
"Did they seem uncomfortable when they
saw Jane?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>"Oh dear, no, my dear. They seemed most
comfortable. Jane bowed to them&mdash;of course
rather coldly, she says&mdash;and they smiled and
nodded, and Valentia kissed her hand to
Laurence. Of course, Jane was very much
pained and shocked about it all. I must say her
first thought, dear, was that I should tell you.
Jane Totness is a thoroughly good woman&mdash;so
thoughtful."</p>

<p>"Do you see anything so very peculiar about
it?" said Mrs. Wyburn. "You know, the young
man&mdash;I disapprove of him as strongly as any
one can&mdash;but he's an artist, and she is his cousin,
and perhaps he wanted to show her something
in the British Museum?"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Wyburn, far be it from me to
look on the dark side of things, but, as Jane
said, who on earth would go to the British
Museum, unless they were dragged there by
force, except to have a private interview?"</p>

<p>"But if he wanted to speak to her alone, I
don't see why he shouldn't call on her."</p>

<p>"That's just it. If it were a simple, innocent,
harmless conversation, that is what he would
have done. But it was quite clear that there was
something clandestine about it, and you may
be quite sure Romer knew nothing of it.
Besides, they are always together."</p>

<p>"It does look odd," said Mrs. Wyburn. "What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>would you advise me to do? Shall I speak to my
son or my daughter-in-law about it?"</p>

<p>"To neither, my dear. If you speak only to
your son, he will tell her, and she will get round
him, and prove there's nothing in it. If you
speak to her she will get round you, and say
that Romer knew all about it. My advice is, if
you really want to put a stop to this flirtation&mdash;I'm
sure it's gossiped about&mdash;even Jane, who
is the last person in the world to talk, speaks of
it to every one. If I were you, I would speak to
the young man himself."</p>

<p>"To Harry de Freyne? Yes, it's rather a good
idea."</p>

<p>It struck Mrs. Wyburn that to do this would,
perhaps, cause more annoyance than anything
else. She was now anxious to get rid of Miss
Westbury, who evidently had nothing more to
impart. But that lady was not so easy to dispose
of. She broke into a long monologue on the
subject of r&eacute;gime, servants, and little dressmakers,
occasionally returning to the subject
of the British Museum, and the shocking frivolity
there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn was just thinking of having a
violent toothache or some other ill, when Miss
Westbury suddenly made up her mind to depart.</p>

<p>As soon as she had gone Mrs. Wyburn flew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>to the Blue Book, looked up Harry's address,
and wrote him the following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Dear Mr. de Freyne,
</p>

<p>"Probably you hardly remember me, but
I have met you on two or three occasions at the
house of my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Romer
Wyburn. There is something I want to say to
you which I hardly like to write. I should be
glad if you would come and see me to-morrow
afternoon at four o'clock. I shall not keep you
long. You may think this a strange request,
knowing you so slightly as I do, but when we
meet, I am sure you will understand.</p>

<p class="blckright">
"Yours truly,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Isabella Wyburn</span>."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having written this note, Mrs. Wyburn felt
too impatient to send it by post; she was simply
longing to know that Harry was feeling uncomfortable,
as he was very certain to feel when
he got the letter. Although she had a great
suspicion and general dislike of the Messenger
Boy Service, she relented for once in their
favour so far as to make use of them, and the
letter was sent by hand.</p>

<p>She was rewarded for thus conquering her
prejudice. Harry was at home, and accepted her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>invitation with most respectful alacrity. His
manners&mdash;especially on paper&mdash;were, with old
and young ladies, always equally perfect&mdash;unless
he was out of temper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn eagerly hoped Harry would see
Valentia, or somehow convey to her about the
letter, because it would be sure to make her
uneasy also.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next day the young man was punctual
to the moment. The old lady left him alone for
a few minutes in the dark, dismal drawing-room.
She thought it would have a salutary
effect.</p>

<p>She found him, when she came in, stroking
the china bird, and looking at himself in the
mirror above it.</p>

<p>He received her with such charming grace
that she felt almost disconcerted, and as if she
ought to apologise.</p>

<p>"You received my letter?" she said, rather
abruptly.</p>

<p>"With great pleasure. That is why I am
here."</p>

<p>He was still standing, smiling delightfully.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said, with cold graciousness.
"I hope you are not in a great hurry?"</p>

<p>"All my day belongs to you," he replied with
a low bow, taking the seat she had indicated.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>He looked at her with soft deference under his
long eyelashes.</p>

<p>She found what she had to say more difficult
than she had expected. She spoke quietly, in
a low yet rasping voice, with a sharp dignity.</p>

<p>"I will come straight to the point. To put it
plainly, a report has reached my ears, Mr. de
Freyne, which has caused me very great pain
and anxiety&mdash;I mean, as a mother. And I
wondered whether you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As a mother? Surely, Mrs. Wyburn, nothing
against Romer? I'm sure I, as one of his oldest
friends...."</p>

<p>"Against Romer!" She drew herself up stiffly.
"Most certainly not! There's never been a word
breathed otherwise than in dear Romer's
favour since he was a little boy."</p>

<p>Harry appeared much relieved.</p>

<p>"It's a great comfort to hear you say that.
It's only what I was going to assure you."</p>

<p>"Besides, do you suppose for one moment
that if I had any fault to find with my son I
should send for you?"</p>

<p>She already had an annoying fancy that he
was defeating her, laughing at her, and turning
the tables.</p>

<p>"It seemed certainly rather strange," Harry
said.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! When I say I was troubled as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>mother, I meant it in a very different sense.
What I'm afraid of is that dear Romer might be
worried if he heard the report to which I refer."</p>

<p>"And that is?..."</p>

<p>She looked at him spitefully, yet with a
reluctant admiration.</p>

<p>He was irritatingly good-looking, good-humoured,
and at his ease, and particularly
well-dressed, without appearing in the least
conscious of it. She wished immensely that he
had been plain, or awkward, or even out at
elbows, or absurdly dandified, or looked <i>nouveau
riche</i>, or something! She felt jealous of him for
Romer, and, at the back of her brain, she
grudgingly and perversely sympathised a little
with her daughter-in-law. Harry radiated a
peculiar charm for women of all ages. He did
not study them nor try very much to please
them; the fascination was involuntary; he
simply used it.</p>

<p>"And that is, that you and my daughter-in-law,
Valentia, were seen <i>alone</i>&mdash;&mdash;" she paused
a moment, showing a latent instinct for
dramatic effect.</p>

<p>He smiled a little more, and bent his head
forward with every sign of intelligent interest.</p>

<p>She spoke with emphasis.</p>

<p>"<i>Alone</i>&mdash;the other morning&mdash;at the British
Museum!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Somehow she felt the shot had missed fire. It
had fallen flat. It was less effective than she had
hoped. It did not sound so very shocking after all.</p>

<p>He continued to smile with the air of waiting
for the climax. She gathered herself together
and went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I heard it from Miss Westbury, so it is a fact!"</p>

<p>Harry thought of saying that he preferred an
old wives' tale any day to an old maid's fact,
but he only smiled on.</p>

<p>"Of course, if this is untrue, Mr. de Freyne&mdash;if
it is a mistake, or a false report, you have
merely to deny it. Assure me it is incorrect&mdash;on
your word of honour&mdash;and I will then contradict
it in the proper quarter."</p>

<p>He decided on his line. "My dear lady, pray
don't contradict it. As a report it is a gem&mdash;it is
unique. Not merely because it's absolutely true&mdash;for,
as a matter of fact, I think most reports
are&mdash;but because of its utter unimportance! It
seems to me so trivial&mdash;so dull&mdash;so wanting in
interest to the general public."</p>

<p>"You think reports are usually true, Mr. de
Freyne?"</p>

<p>"I am convinced they are. I believe firmly in
the no-smoke-without-fire theory. Oh, do you
know, I think it is <i>so</i> true!... This certainly
is true&mdash;it's a solemn fact."</p>

<p>"You admit it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>"I do indeed! Surely I could hardly refuse to
go when I was asked?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you were asked?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And Romer is really such a very
old friend of mine, I could hardly refuse his
request. I may be wrong, but I think one should
always be ready to take a little trouble for an
old friend."</p>

<p>"No doubt you have very strict ideas on the
duties and obligations of friendship! At <i>his</i>
request&mdash;my son's?"</p>

<p>"Yes; your son asked me to go and escort
Valentia."</p>

<p>"It is very peculiar; you must see that your
explanation sounds extremely odd."</p>

<p>"Not at all odd," he answered softly, "if you
will allow me to contradict you." He thought a
moment. Then he went on: "You may have
heard, perhaps, about the dance that little
American, Mrs. Newhaven, is getting up at the
Grafton Galleries for <i>Deaf and Dumb Dogs and
Cats</i>. No? Well, every one is going, and they're
arranging to have, by way of novelty, Quadrilles
of different nationalities. Romer and his wife
are to dance in the Egyptian Quadrille, and he
asked me to take her to the British Museum to
look round and see if we could find some inspiration
for Egyptian costumes that wouldn't
be too impossible. But when we got there, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>suddenly remembered the awful story about
one of the mummies being unlucky, so we went
into the Print Room and remained there."</p>

<p>De Freyne paused.</p>

<p>"Of course, if that is all&mdash;if my son knows of
your going, and even asked you to go, there's
nothing more to be said ... though I think it
very foolish, and I don't approve of any of that
sort of thing at all."</p>

<p>"What, not of Egyptian quadrilles, Mrs.
Wyburn?" asked Harry, with surprised innocence
and in a coaxing voice. "Why, I'm sure
it will be frightfully harmless&mdash;in fact, very
invigorating to the mind. It's not as though the
dresses were becoming! We saw the most hideous
things at the Museum. We met Lady Totness,
who was dragging a wretched little boy about&mdash;I
suppose as a punishment for something."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn smiled slightly. She began to
feel rather inclined to relent at the implication
that Lady Totness was hideous.</p>

<p>"There you really are wrong, Mr. de Freyne.
The boy was taken there as a treat."</p>

<p>"A <i>treat</i>! For whom? For him? What a
strange idea&mdash;I mean, to think it could be a
treat to go anywhere with her, Mrs. Wyburn."</p>

<p>"It is, rather," she acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if that is really all that was
troubling you, I do hope you're happy now?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>He said this with one of his subtle, insinuating
changes of tone that were always so effective.
Musicians will understand when I say it was
like a change from the common chord in the
minor to the dominant in the major. It was
partly from force of habit, partly because he
really wished to win Mrs. Wyburn over.</p>

<p>"Of course, now you've given the explanation
it's, <i>so far</i>, all right. You'll have a cup of tea
with me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I should enjoy it particularly. Let me ring."
After a minute or two she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But perhaps I might venture to suggest it
might be better&mdash;more prudent&mdash;if you were
to go about a little less with Valentia?... Of
course, I quite see now that you're so devoted
to Romer, and like a brother and so forth, but
I can't help considering what people say."</p>

<p>"Don't call Lady Totness people, Mrs.
Wyburn! Think what a disagreeable, insincere
woman she is&mdash;not a bit <i>femme du monde</i>, and
so exceptionally stupid and spiteful!"</p>

<p>Harry stayed with her for an hour, having
tea, chatting, telling her stories against every
one she didn't like, and speaking with a kind
of tender and admiring familiarity of both
Valentia and Romer, in a way that at once
reassured and flattered her.</p>

<p>Finally, she actually found herself begging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Harry to use his influence with the young
couple to be less frivolous and mondains, and
not to be always going out, which he promised
to do. She even confided to him her great wish
that they had two or three children, which
would steady them down, and he warmly
agreed with her, but said that he felt that on
that subject it was, perhaps, hardly for him to
interfere.</p>

<p>Of course he confided in her, in his turn,
how frightfully hard up one was, with no one
buying pictures, and outsiders winning all the
big races after having no earthly chance on any
form they had shown that season. Mrs. Wyburn
positively tried to talk racing with him for a
minute or two&mdash;rather pathetically&mdash;but soon
got out of her depth and fell back on Art. She
said she thought, candidly, that Harry's portrait
of his cousin was a pity.</p>

<p>They parted excellent friends, she even asking
him as a favour not to tell Romer the reason
of his visit. To Valentia he might mention it, as
Mrs. Wyburn thought it might be a lesson to her.</p>

<p>Harry professed, at first, some little scruple
on the point. He scarcely liked, he said, the
idea of concealing it from Romer. They always
told each other everything. But Mrs. Wyburn
was afraid of her son's anger&mdash;which she could
not endure, unless <i>she</i> was in the right&mdash;and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>appearing ridiculously meddling. Harry owned
that her conduct <i>might</i> seem rather malicious
and absurd. At last he consented, and it was
agreed that neither of them should ever say
anything about it to Romer at all.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that Harry kept
his promise of silence to the letter. Had he not
done so the story would at least have had the
interest of novelty, for Romer had never yet
heard anything about the expedition to the
British Museum, and he never did.</p>

<p>A week or two later, when Mrs. Newhaven's
ball at the Grafton Galleries was described in
the paper, Mrs. Wyburn, who read the account,
observed that there was no reference whatever
to quadrilles of various nationalities&mdash;Egyptian
or otherwise; and she rather wondered at the
omission. But it did not occur to her to suppose
that this portion of the entertainment had been
entirely imaginary&mdash;a lurid figment of Harry's
vivid fancy and fertile invention.</p>

<p>He left, it must be said, on the old lady a
lasting impression&mdash;by no means an unfavourable
one. Even when she had reason to grow
seriously anxious again on the same subject,
she never could bring herself in her own mind
to blame Harry&mdash;she could not at heart think
ill of him. She was only extremely angry with
Romer and Valentia.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE FRIENDS</h3>


<p>Harry had baffled Mrs. Wyburn for the
time. He always dealt with his difficulties
one by one as they cropped up, not <i>en masse</i>,
and invariably in a manner that relieved the
tension for a short time only&mdash;he rarely did
anything radical.</p>

<p>His financial position was, however, growing
rather serious, and occasionally the thought of
Miss Walmer flitted through his mind.</p>

<p>To marry Miss Walmer would be far the
quickest and simplest way out of his difficulties,
and she would really be very little trouble, as
little trouble, perhaps, as any wife could be.
Besides, Harry had, with reason, great confidence
in his own powers of dealing with
women&mdash;getting whatever it was that he
wanted from them, and afterwards preventing
their being a nuisance. But he did not much like
the idea of this mercenary marriage, because he
was not in the least tired of his romance with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Valentia, and saw great difficulties in the way
of keeping it up later on. He had worrying
doubts as to her consenting to revive it afterwards
if he married.</p>

<p>Her grey eyes and soft fair hair with its
dense waves held a lasting fascination for him.
It has been well said that for each individual
there exists in some other being some detail
which he or she could find only in this particular
person. It might be the merest trifle. Harry
knew what it was in Val that had a specially
compelling charm to him&mdash;it was the way her
hair grew on her forehead. And there was
something childlike in her expression that made
a peculiar appeal to him. The power her face
had over him was undiminished&mdash;it had begun
seriously when he painted her portrait, and had
grown gradually since then. And she was the
only woman he had ever met whose affection
for him did not cool his own enthusiasm. On
the contrary, it was one of the things which
held him to her most.</p>

<p>In a sense he was even loyal to her. Harry was
not one of those extravagant Don Juans who
made conquests solely for the gratification of
their vanity by adding to their collection.
Essentially cool and calculating, he used his
attractiveness only when he thought it would
be of some genuine value to him, or some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>real satisfaction. As a Lovelace he was economical.</p>

<p>Though a great connoisseur of feminine
charm and beauty, and superficially susceptible
and excitable, with all this, as many women
knew, Harry was as hard as nails.</p>

<p>Valentia was the only woman for whom he
had ever felt, besides the physical attraction, a
kind of indulgent tenderness. This was partly,
no doubt, because they had been fond of each
other as children, and because of a racial sympathy,
a <i>sentiment de famille</i> due to their
relationship. But it was not really to be depended
on.</p>

<p>No one could be a more charmingly devoted
lover than Harry. There was no one like him
for little attentions and inattentions, charming
little thoughts, caressing words, and the little
jealous scenes that women value. It was not
the mere mechanically experienced love-making
that women see through and to which they
often prefer a clumsy sincerity. It was natural,
spontaneous. He had, in fact, a genius for love-making,
but he had not, like Romer, a genius
for love. Harry had all the gift of expression&mdash;poor
Romer had only the gift of feeling.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding Harry's magnetism, a
woman once disillusioned by him was disillusioned
for ever. Women never forgave him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>His romances generally ended suddenly, and
always irrevocably.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Harry had no great love of truth in the abstract,
but, at least, he never deceived himself.
He saw through his own unscrupulousness, and
rather despised it just as he despised his own
work as a painter. He had grown really fond
of Van Buren for the simple, sincere qualities
in which Harry knew himself to be deficient;
and the American's whole-hearted admiration&mdash;almost
infatuation&mdash;for him gave Harry the
pleasure one feels in the frank devotion of a
child. It touched him, even while he intended
to make use of it, because it was his nature to
make use of everything. It is an infallible sign
of the second-rate in nature and intellect to
make use of everything and every one. The
genius is incapable of making use of people. It
is for the second-rate clever people to make use
of him.</p>

<p>One morning Harry had heard unexpectedly
that he had sold a picture&mdash;a thing that rarely
happened&mdash;and was looking at the cheque he
had received, when Van Buren came into the
studio. Harry told the news.</p>

<p>"Well, Harry, I do congratulate you, with
all my heart! What are you going to do with
that?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>"Frame it," said Harry. "It's the only one
I've had for three years. It's a curiosity."</p>

<p>The American laughed.</p>

<p>"Harry, I guess what you're really going to
do&mdash;you're going to give yourself the humble
joy of paying some of the more pressing
liabilities. I know you!"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, that would be mad extravagance!
Oh no. You see, this cheque is&mdash;just
enough to be no earthly use."</p>

<p>Van Buren sat down.</p>

<p>"Harry, if you'd only let me.... But I know
that vexes you, so I won't talk of it. You're
Quixotic, that's what's the matter with you."
He smiled, pleased with the word. "Yes,
Quixotic! I want to speak to you about your
cousin&mdash;I mean Miss Daphne, the beauteous
broo-nette."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you think you're getting on?"
asked Harry, who already knew from Valentia
that it was hopeless.</p>

<p>"Not as well as I should like, Harry. I can't
say I feel I'm making any very great progress.
She's a dream, but I'm afraid she regards me
as a heavy-weight. She's only a child, really,
I know. She would prefer a little boy of her
own age who would make her laugh. Maybe
she thinks I'm too old. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"You must give her time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>"I pay her every little attention that I can,"
said Van Buren seriously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're too attentive."</p>

<p>"I'd give her anything in the world she
wanted, Harry, if she'd let me."</p>

<p>"Well, give her a miss for safety."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;this evening you're going to meet
her at a dance, aren't you&mdash;at the Walmers'?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm looking forward to that."</p>

<p>"Well, don't go&mdash;don't turn up. Then she'll
miss you. Say, to-morrow, you were prevented."</p>

<p>Van Buren began to smile.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. It's an idea. You do
hand me some good advice! Is it what you
would do yourself, Harry?"</p>

<p>"It's what I'm always doing."</p>

<p>"But then I don't like the idea of being rude.
One always wants to give the impression of being
well-bred, no matter what the facts maybe."</p>

<p>"It won't be rude. She'll be thinking about
you much more than if you were there, wondering
why you're not."</p>

<p>"You mean it will keep her guessing, Harry?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea. I shan't say you're not
coming. I'll pretend to be expecting you too."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I'll try that. I know I've only
got an outside chance. She counts me as one of
the also-rans."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>"Are you really very devoted, old chap? Would
you break your heart if it didn't come off?"</p>

<p>Van Buren thought a moment, then said with
his scrupulous truthfulness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, no: I can hardly say that, Harry. I'm
not so far gone as all that. But I think she's
a very beautiful, charming, well-brought-up
young lady&mdash;a typical English girl&mdash;a June rose,
a real peach. She's the ideal of the sort of girl
I'd like to marry. But if she's out of my reach&mdash;well,
I should resign myself."</p>

<p>"Would you try for some one else? There are
probably about a million girls just like that, you
know, who would be only too delighted."</p>

<p>Van Buren shook his head.</p>

<p>"She's the only girl I should care about marrying.
If it doesn't come off I shall go back to
New York. And I do wish you'd come with me.
A fellow with your talents would do splendidly
there. Why, I'd find you a place in the Bank in
New York. I'd see you made your fortune
pretty quick. But you'd never leave London."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure. Anyway, we'll give it a
chance till the autumn."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must see it to a finish."</p>

<p>"If you don't settle down here, then, would
you marry an American girl?"</p>

<p>"No. In that case I shan't marry at all. I shall
settle down to the life of a lonely bachelor&mdash;choose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>the broad and easy path that leads to
single misery, Harry." He laughed.</p>

<p>"Instead of the straight and narrow road that
leads to married unhappiness," said Harry.
"So you <i>are</i> very keen on Daphne?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly that, perhaps. But it must be
her or no one for a life-partner. She's the only
girl who ever made any appeal to me from the
point of view of domestic life. When I think of
a happy home and a fireside with her, it makes
me curl like an autumn leaf."</p>

<p>"What a curious chap you are," said Harry,
smiling.</p>

<p>"See here," said Van Buren, taking a letter
out of his pocket. "I've got a letter from a lady&mdash;it's
signed Flora Luscombe&mdash;but I don't seem
to remember anything about her."</p>

<p>Harry took the letter. It was written on
mauve paper in a somewhat straggling hand,
and was dated from "Dimsdale Mansions,
St. Stephen's Road, North Kensington." It was
a pathetic, yet cheery invitation to tea.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Luscombe, of the Tank, as we call
it," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, the actress? Well, I think I shall go,
Harry. I've never had the opportunity of mixing
much in dramatic circles. It's real kind of
her to have asked me, I must say. I didn't even
remember her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>"No one ever remembers her. But it's amusing
and absurd. You'll meet some of the people
you like. Flora will show you round&mdash;point out
all the obscurities there, and so forth. Oh, she's
a good soul&mdash;old Flora."</p>

<p>"Is she old, Harry?"</p>

<p>"About twenty-three, or thirty-three. I like
her, though she's rather a snob."</p>

<p>"Ah, they say all Americans are snobs, Harry,
but I feel sure I'm not. Still, if I really liked a
man I can't say I should turn against him even
if he had a title."</p>

<p>"And if I really hated a person I should never
get to like him, even if he had a bad reputation."</p>

<p>Van Buren looked surprised and impressed,
also delighted.</p>

<p>"Is that a paradox, or an epigram, Harry?"</p>

<p>"I can't think!"</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>"It's bosh," said Harry impressively, "mere
bosh!"</p>

<p>"Tell me what you really mean by it."</p>

<p>"How should I know? I haven't the very
slightest idea," Harry said, stretching himself.</p>

<p>Van Buren looked thoughtfully out of the
window.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose our ro-mances will
end?"</p>

<p>"As badly as possible; romances always do,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>said Harry. "We ought to be only too thankful
that they end at all."</p>

<p>"Why, I'm afraid you're a pessimist! How
do you define a pessimist, Harry?"</p>

<p>"What a mania you have for definition, old
chap! I think I agree with the little girl who
said that an optimist is the man who looks after
your eyes, and the pessimist the person who
looks after your feet."</p>

<p>"Why, that's very subtle. I quite see what
she means. There's a lot in that idea, Harry."
He thought gravely.</p>

<p>"Is there? Well, come out to lunch."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A HOME CHAT</h3>


<p>"Yes, Romer, on the whole I don't think
our season's been a success. With any
amount of struggle, worry, bother, clothes,
motoring, and making up parties, we've just
succeeded in not getting Daphne married to
Van Buren, and putting your mother in a perpetual,
constant, lasting bad temper."</p>

<p>"Have we?" said Romer.</p>

<p>He was sitting in an arm-chair listening, as
usual, while Valentia talked. He did not always
understand what she was saying, nor did he
even always know the subject she was discussing,
but he loved to hear her voice, that was
like an incantation in his ears. He said a few
words occasionally, desiring that the musical
sound should continue.</p>

<p>"All our old friends seem to have grown dull
and sensible except Harry, and he's been rather
jerky and unsatisfactory&mdash;and all the new ones
have turned out complete failures. When I say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>they're complete failures, of course I mean
they've bored me. But, of course, it may not
have been their object in life to do anything
else."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Look at Mr. Rathbone&mdash;a man like that,
tattooed, and collecting old programmes of theatres.
Well, he's as dull as ditchwater, perfectly
stupid and always saying the right thing to the
wrong people. Then Captain Foster, who seemed
perfectly harmless and only decorative,
turns out to be really dangerous, and to count.
He's in love with Daphne, and he has got his
mother, who is very weak and foolish and
sentimental, round on his side, and Daphne's
always going to tea or to lunch there, and
they've utterly spoilt her&mdash;at least, her taste
in hats has gone all wrong, and she told me that
Mrs. Foster had pink paper shavings in her
drawing-room fireplace, and asked me why I
didn't have them too!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And though she's very good, I know
it'll end in our having to give in, and a pretty
wedding, and a tiny flat, and utter wretchedness!
And Daphne will get to like old Mrs.
Foster better than me, and they'll have five
hundred a year at the most; and even if they
aren't really miserable she'll have to gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>grow suburban, and come up to the theatre and
have to rush off so as to catch the last train
back to Boshan or Doddington or somewhere!
I mean if they take a little house out of town&mdash;near
Mrs. Foster. However, I'm not going to
give in just yet.... I could understand a slight
sacrifice&mdash;or even a big one if I were in love
with Captain Foster, but I'm not. I suppose
you'll say that I needn't be, but that isn't the
point. The utter absurdity is that all Daphne
wants of him she could see now. No one minds
her seeing him. But why should she break up
her life and spoil her future for it? Of course,
<i>that</i> part is <i>his</i> idea. He is so selfish that he
isn't satisfied with the harmless fun they have
now, but wants her to live all her life in a sort
of workman's cottage or tenement building just
for the sake of the joy, privilege, and honour of
having every meal with him!"</p>

<p>"What a brute!" said Romer mildly.</p>

<p>"Isn't he? And suppose a war broke out, and
that darling, handsome boy perhaps put an end
to suddenly by a bullet, or mentioned in despatches,
or something, and promoted&mdash;oh,
please don't talk to me about it any more,
Romer. I hate the life. But I suppose she'll have
to go her own way."</p>

<p>Valentia paused and looked pensively in the
glass.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>"And dear Van Buren, he's been pretty badly
treated, I think. I suppose he knows it isn't my
fault or Harry's. I try to make up for it in lots
of ways&mdash;by getting him an introduction to the
man who wants to fly across the Atlantic. I
really hoped he would say to Van Buren, 'Fly
with me!' but he didn't, and in the most
roundabout way and by the most fearful lot of
trouble&mdash;chiefly through me&mdash;he was asked to
dinner to meet that other man&mdash;I forget his
name, the one who keeps on discovering the
North Pole. And it seems he is a dear, and
awfully good-looking. And then he&mdash;Van, I
mean&mdash;has met Bernard Shaw, and Graham
White, and Lloyd George, and Thomas Hardy,
and Sargent, and Lord Roberts, and Henry
James, and even Gabrielle Ray, so he hasn't
had such a bad time in London. I don't see that
he has anything to complain of, do you, Romer?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't think so."</p>

<p>"That was what he wanted, you know,"
continued Valentia. "But if we couldn't get
him a wife as well, it's not our fault. I'm sure
we've tried our best. He's such a dear, and very
fond of England. He has been most useful to
Harry, I'm sure; and&mdash;&mdash;I think the new
fashions are simply frightful. The new way
they're going to do the hair will be revoltingly
unbecoming, and the whole thing will make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>every one look hopelessly dowdy. The smarter
you are, the more of a frump you will look!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Val!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you will&mdash;I mean I will, but I won't....
Because I'm not going to follow the fashion like
a sheep. And if you're not very careful I shall
dress in a style of my own."</p>

<p>"Like a sheep! Do sheep follow the fashion?"</p>

<p>"Of course they do. Didn't you know that?
What one does all the rest do. Of course it
doesn't change so often&mdash;even in the best
Southdown circles&mdash;at least <i>we</i> don't notice the
change. When a new kind of 'baa' comes in and
they all echo it we don't see any difference, but
I don't suppose they see any difference in our
fashions either. Oh, and Romer, I've been
worried because I feel I've got so frightfully
empty-headed and unintellectual through just
<i>living</i>, never reading or thinking, when we go
down to the Green Gate I shall read a lot of
serious books. I'm going to read H. G. Wells,
and Hichens, and Aristotle, and some history,
and all sorts of 'improving' things. When are
we going?"</p>

<p>"As soon as possible," said Romer, brightening
up. "Let's go next Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't be ready quite as soon as that,
Romer dear! Let's go on Tuesday. I'll arrange
it all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>"Good!" said Romer, beaming.</p>

<p>"And I'll get Harry to come down with us."</p>

<p>"Thought he was going yachting with the
Walmers?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, he's not, after all.... He doesn't
really care for the sea."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Harry, of course, is sorry for Van Buren,"
continued Valentia. "And yet he takes Daphne's
part about Cyril Foster. He knows it's spoiling
her, but he thinks she ought to be spoilt; he's
so fond of Daphne."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he marry her himself?" asked
Romer.</p>

<p>"Harry?" She looked at him in surprise.
"Why, Romer, what a harpist you are. If I've
told you once, I've told you a hundred times, he
never marries! Harry has a great many bad
habits, goodness knows. But marrying isn't one
of them."</p>

<p>"Do you think he's keen on some one else?"
asked Romer after a rather long pause.</p>

<p>She seemed annoyed at the question, then
smiled again.</p>

<p>"I don't know! The other day I called at the
studio unexpectedly to ask for something I'd
forgotten, and found Harry improvising at the
piano&mdash;you know that way he has of improvising
from memory&mdash;an inaccurate memory&mdash;of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>some well-known composer. I've never
known him do it except when he wanted to&mdash;please
some woman. Well, Lady Walmer was
there, leaning over the piano and listening.
Should you think from that he's keen, as you
call it, on her?"</p>

<p>"Lady Walmer! At her age!"</p>

<p>"Why, Romer, she's no older than anybody
else! It doesn't matter nowadays in the very
slightest degree whether one is twenty-eight,
or thirty-eight, or even forty-eight. To a
modern man it's all exactly the same. Of course,
if a flapper is what is required, well then,
naturally, he must be shown to another department.
But apart from that&mdash;why, Lady Walmer
would be quite as dangerous a rival for me as a
woman ten years or twenty years younger.
And I'm not twenty-five yet."</p>

<p>"Rival to <i>you</i>? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Romer stared at her, a spark of his fanatic
admiration showing in his eyes.</p>

<p>She laughed and hurried on.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I never mean anything. I know
what you think, Harry is not a marrying man,
but he might become one. But a girl like Alec
Walmer! With the figure of a suffragette and
the mind of a canary who plays cricket, or a
goose who goes in for golf&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heaps of cash."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>"Yes, I know. But Harry's an artist&mdash;he needs
sympathy."</p>

<p>"He's got his head screwed on the right way."</p>

<p>"But his heart's in the right place."</p>

<p>"What is the right place?"</p>

<p>"Don't be irritating, Romer. We'll go to the
Green Gate on Monday then. And now I must
go out and order a short tweed skirt, and a
garden roller, and a few other things that we
shall need in the country. Leave it all to me!
No, I never forget anything; even your mother
says I'm practical. And oh, do let's try and put
her in a good temper before we go away. You'd
better go and see her and say good-bye to-day,
early in the afternoon, alone. And then I'll go
in late and take away the impression of anything
you've said wrong. Do you see, darling? Dear
Romer!"</p>

<p>She went out of the room like a sunbeam in
a hurry.</p>

<p>Romer followed her with a wondering expression.
To him her movements, her hair, her eyes
seemed to suggest some fascinating language he
had not yet learnt. She seemed to him almost
a magic creature.</p>

<p>As usual, he showed his sensations simply by
obeying. He went to say good-bye to his mother.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>VALENTIA'S VISIT</h3>


<p>Romer's mother, looking intensely cross&mdash;it
was her form of deep thought&mdash;was re-embroidering,
with extra little stitches, and
unnecessary little French knots, and elaborate
little buttonholes that would never see
a button, a large and fine piece of embroidery
on which she had been working for many
months. She had that decadent love of minute
finish in the unessential so often seen in persons
of a nervous yet persistent temperament.</p>

<p>She was expecting her daughter-in-law.
Romer had said, "Val will look in this afternoon."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Valentia arrived, delightfully dressed, and,
to the casual observer, looking just as usual, but
in her costume there was just that nuance of
difference&mdash;what was it?&mdash;extra sobriety, a
more subdued look&mdash;some trifle that she had
worn last year to suggest to the seeing eye a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>hint of praiseworthy economy?&mdash;at any rate,
a shade that other young married women
would recognise at once as the right note when
calling on one's mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn greeted her with real pleasure,
and with far more warmth than she ever
showed to her son (her affection for him being
authentic). The sight of Valentia, however,
always genuinely raised her spirits. She was
fascinated by her, and had an obscure desire
to gain Valentia's liking, and even admiration&mdash;by
force, if necessary! At the same time she
felt jealousy, disapproval, an odd pride in the
girl's charming appearance, and a venomous
desire to give her slight pain.</p>

<p>"Romer has been here, I see&mdash;I mean, I
guess he has by the cigarette. He's the only
person who's allowed to smoke here. Yes,
Mrs. Wyburn, we're off on Wednesday. Won't
you miss us awfully? But I shall be very glad
to go. I've really had enough of the season."
Val spoke with a shade of weariness.</p>

<p>"No wonder! I suppose you've hardly had
one quiet evening at home the last three weeks?"</p>

<p>"Very likely not one. Even when we're
quite alone Harry comes round, and often his
American friend too."</p>

<p>This was a challenge.</p>

<p>Valentia was sitting opposite the light, dressed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>in blue, in a black hat of moderate size, looking
straight at the elder lady with a smile, and
stirring her cup of tea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn admired her pluck and the fit
of her dress.</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly&mdash;just what I should have
thought. You know what a horror I have of
displaying anything in the shape or form of
<i>interference</i>, dear Valentia. But, since you've
mentioned it yourself, may I just say, doesn't
it seem almost a pity that you should never be
alone with your husband?"</p>

<p>Valentia began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, really, Mrs. Wyburn, why do you
assume that? But of course we're longing for a
quiet time. That is why we're going away so
early. What <i>delicious</i> China tea! Yours is the
only house where one gets it quite like this."</p>

<p>She put down her cup, which was more than
half full, with a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"Romer hates China tea too," said Mrs.
Wyburn. "It would be really better for your
nerves if you'd drink it, my dear."</p>

<p>"And when do you go to Bournemouth?"</p>

<p>"The first week in August. So I shall be able
to come down one day&mdash;as Romer asked me&mdash;before
I go, and just have a peep at what you're
all doing at the Green Gate."</p>

<p>She smiled with grotesque playfulness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>"Oh, that will be nice," said Valentia. "It
must be looking lovely now. Did Romer say
anything else of any importance?"</p>

<p>"He never says much, as you know, important
or not! He's very like his poor father, who
really used to sit opposite to me for hours at a
time without opening his lips."</p>

<p>"A strong, silent man," murmured Val sympathetically.
"I know so well what you mean."</p>

<p>"Indeed you don't," snapped Mrs. Wyburn.
"He was the weakest creature&mdash;<i>morally</i>, I
mean, poor dear&mdash;that ever breathed. He was
a very tall, fine man, but yet any pretty woman
could turn him round her little finger! It was
his most marked characteristic."</p>

<p>"Fancy! Devoted to you, of course. Romer's
often told me."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he hasn't. What can Romer know
of my domestic troubles, as he was just four
when he lost his poor father? But however that
may be, I do hope, Valentia, you will wear
warm, <i>sensible</i> clothes for the garden. I never
quite like the idea of your sitting out on that
little terrace late in the evening with practically
nothing on your shoulders. People should
be so careful of the night air."</p>

<p>"How thoughtful of you, Mrs. Wyburn! But
I have a wrap&mdash;I never sit out without a wrap."</p>

<p>"Pink chiffon, I suppose?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>"Now how did you know? You seem to have
second sight!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I guessed as much. Very candidly, dear
Valentia, I don't approve of pink chiffon. But
we women of an elder generation are never
listened to, though our advice is worth hearing,
I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Mrs. Wyburn, don't say that. What
would you advise instead then&mdash;a red crochet
woollen shawl? I'll get one, of course. How
lovely that embroidery is getting that you're
doing! I remember last February thinking that
it was as beautiful as it could be, and now it
is more wonderful still. Let me look."</p>

<p>She bent down her pretty head to admire it.</p>

<p>"Is it my fancy, or the light, or hasn't your
hair grown a little brighter in colour lately,
Valentia dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you really think so? I'm so glad. I
was afraid it was just the same&mdash;just as it was
in Harry's portrait of me, you know."</p>

<p>"It does look very like the portrait. But, very
frankly&mdash;you won't mind my saying so?&mdash;I
think that if it were not quite so fair it would
be an improvement."</p>

<p>"Oh, naughty Mrs. Wyburn! Fancy your
wanting me to touch up my hair&mdash;make it
dark at the roots, I suppose, as so many people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>seem to do! Oh! I wouldn't! What would
Romer say? He likes it like this."</p>

<p>Before the elder lady had quite recovered
from the blow, Valentia went on carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Daphne sent her love to you. She mayn't
have time to come and see you before we leave."</p>

<p>"Has she been going to any more fancy balls
as Rosalind?" asked Mrs. Wyburn sarcastically.</p>

<p>"No, oh no. There haven't been any more."</p>

<p>"I heard a report&mdash;oh, only a report&mdash;that
Mr. Van Buren is a great admirer of your
sister's; indeed, it was even said that they were
going to be engaged."</p>

<p>This was really a sore subject to Valentia.
Her temper began to waver slightly. It had been
a very pet scheme of hers, and only Daphne
herself had defeated it by refusing the millionaire.
But of course she knew better than to tell
Mrs. Wyburn that.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you heard that. I believe he does
admire her very much. But I hope I'm not
going to lose Daphne yet."</p>

<p>Something in her expression warned Mrs.
Wyburn, who said affectionately&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, there's plenty of time; she's <i>so</i> young.
I don't believe in girls marrying till they're
sensible women and know something of housekeeping,
and are fitted to deal with their
servants."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>"I hope you haven't been having any more
trouble with yours lately?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I have! I had just sent for the housemaid
to give her notice because she never dusts
the lustres properly, when she turned round
and gave it&mdash;notice, I mean&mdash;to <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"What a blessing! It saved you the trouble."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, if you knew anything of
domestics, Valentia, you would see that it put
me in a most awkward position&mdash;most awkward;
and now I shall have to live at Mrs.
Hunt's!"</p>

<p>"To live at Mrs. Hunt's?" repeated Val, as if
stupefied. "Why, you're not going to leave your
charming house? And who is Mrs. Hunt?&mdash;an
old friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"Don't you really know who Mrs. Hunt is,
Valentia?" Mrs. Wyburn's voice trembled.</p>

<p>"No; I haven't the faintest idea."</p>

<p>"She's a Registry Off&mdash;&mdash;Well, may you
never know! Certainly I'm not going to leave
my house. The idea of such a thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad," said Val, getting up. "I'm
afraid I must leave it, though. I have so many
little things to do before I go. Now, Mrs.
Wyburn, take great care of yourself, and I do
<i>hope</i> you'll get a nice housemaid quite soon.
That sort of thing is so worrying, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn accompanied her to the door,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>and as usual stood on the landing with her,
complaining of various troubles, and finally
parted with caressing words and advice about
going for country clothes to "a little dressmaker&mdash;quite
near here&mdash;who runs up one's blouses
and skirts."</p>

<p>"Does she? Fancy! She must be small! Good-bye!" ...</p>

<p>... "What a woman!" murmured Val as she
got into the carriage.</p>

<p>"What a wife for Romer!" exclaimed Mrs.
Wyburn as the door shut.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A SUGGESTION</h3>


<p>Miss Luscombe, humming a tune, was
wandering round her drawing-room, arranging
it. She always hummed a little tune
when she was alone, if possible some quaint old
French air. Not that she was really alone now;
only her invisible mother was with her. To do
her justice, Flora took as much trouble to impress
this almost imperceptible audience as if
she represented a large crowd.</p>

<p>"There!" she said. She dusted a little blue
vase and put it further back. "Now you're nice
and tidy. No, you go back there, you ugly
thing!" pouting at a photograph, "you're not
wanted to-day! Come out more in the light,
Lady Charles! We want you to be seen. <i>That's</i>
better!"</p>

<p>From the depths of an arm-chair, where she
was hidden, Mrs. Luscombe, who was watching
her with intense irritation, said sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who do you expect to-day?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>"Oh! how you startled me, Mummy! I didn't
know you were there.... Isn't it funny, when
you wear that dark red dress, <i>just</i> the colour of
the armchair, one doesn't see you?"</p>

<p>She went on humming in the low, sweet
voice, "<i>La violette double, double&mdash;la violette
double-ra-ra.</i>"</p>

<p>"Pray stop that, Flora. My nerves won't bear
it. Who did you say you expect?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rathbone, darling, if you <i>must</i> know.
Mr. John Ryland Rathbone, to be exact. You
know he's one of the Catford Rathbones, don't
you, Mummy?"</p>

<p>"What's a Catford Rathbone?"</p>

<p>"Dear mamma!" she laughed. "It's quite a
good old family. One of the untitled aristocracy."</p>

<p>"I thought you told me his father was a
farmer?"</p>

<p>"No, dear&mdash;that's a little mistake. I told you
his father had <i>taken</i> to farming&mdash;as a hobby.
Besides, that's just what I mean&mdash;a fine old yeoman
stock&mdash;the backbone of the country."</p>

<p>"Why are you praising up this Mr. Backbone&mdash;or
Rathbone&mdash;so much? Is he in love with
you?"</p>

<p>Flora laughed coquettishly, putting on her
Russian Princess manner. It was voluble, disdainful,
and condescending. She often changed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>quite suddenly, from an <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> to a <i>grande
dame</i>, and then to an adventuress and back again
before you knew where you were.</p>

<p>"Of course he's in love with me. What of
that? Poor boy, he must take his chance like the
others! '<i>La violette double, double&mdash;&mdash;</i>' Oh, I
forgot, dear. I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"What's he coming here for?" pursued the
relentless mother.</p>

<p>Miss Luscombe now became a soubrette of a
somewhat hooligan type, and pretended to
throw a little feather duster she was holding
into the depths of the arm-chair.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. But I'm a girl who
knows how to take care of herself. I shall keep
him in his place, old dear. Don't you worry."</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>There was a ring at the door. Flora blushed
genuinely, and put some powder on. She became
sweet and tactful again, and refined, the
amiable woman of the world. She helped her
mother out of the arm-chair, quite unnecessarily,
but perhaps to hurry her departure.</p>

<p>"You'd better leave us alone now, darling,"
she said, "and girlie will tell you all about it
afterwards."</p>

<p>Mrs. Luscombe ran like a hare through a side
door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>The servant announced, throwing open the
folding doors, "Mr. Rathbone."</p>

<p>In two seconds the feather-duster was behind
a screen, and Flora, looking really very handsome&mdash;she
was, as usual in the daytime, in
semi-evening dress&mdash;was reading a little book
covered in old vellum, and kept for the purpose
of her being found reading it. She put it down
and welcomed her guest charmingly.</p>

<p>Rathbone, looking very fair and pink and
rather determined, had brought with him a
kind of case containing his collection of old
theatre programmes, so that he gave the impression
of being a diplomat of high importance
with a portfolio.</p>

<p>She helped him prettily to show her the programmes,
and was pleased to see that there was
something else on his mind.</p>

<p>She gave him a cigarette and they had tea. He
told her the ancient story of his writing to Cissie
Loftus, and how he had never received an
answer. She welcomed the anecdote as though
it combined the brilliance of a jewel with the
freshness of a daisy.</p>

<p>Then he spoke in a somewhat thick voice and
with that rather gruff manner that she associated
with sincerity.</p>

<p>"Miss Luscombe, I ..."&mdash;he sighed deeply.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>"To tell you the truth, there's something&mdash;for a
long time I've wanted to ask you."</p>

<p>He fixed on her intently his blue eyes, in
which there was an ardent glare.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Rathbone? What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"A great deal. The question is, what would
you do for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that depends," she said, smiling, looking
down, and enjoying herself.</p>

<p>"Not to put too fine a point upon it, Miss
Luscombe&mdash;&mdash;"; he stopped nervously.</p>

<p>"Miss Luscombe sounds so formal," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't allow me to call you Flora,
would you?"</p>

<p>He smiled, but she thought he looked disappointed.
Perhaps he was a man who needed
difficulties&mdash;opposition.</p>

<p>"Well ... I ... it depends," she said.</p>

<p>"Look here, Flora, you're a very charming
woman. I have a great admiration for you. What
is more, I believe you to be a thoroughly
good&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated again; was he going to
say 'woman,' 'actress?'&mdash;he decided on 'sort.'</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Now I'll reveal to you the dream of my life,
which I wouldn't tell to anybody else."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I can guess it?" she said, wishing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>he would hurry up. Lady Charles was coming
at half-past five to get the address of that fur
place Flora knew of, where you got things practically
for nothing&mdash;and they were worth it, too.</p>

<p>"I know I'm not so very young," continued
the young man.</p>

<p>"Why, you're only about thirty-four, aren't
you? I call that young."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;do you really? Now I was afraid
I was getting rather too old to begin, as it were,
a fresh life. Well now"&mdash;he came a little nearer
and touched her hand, which lay on the table; it
was a pretty hand, thin and bony, with pink
polished nails and a garnet ring&mdash;"will you do
it for me? will you help me? will you not think
me foolish&mdash;too daring&mdash;too sanguine?..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I see you've guessed. Yes. I want to
go on the stage."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>MISS WALMER</h3>


<p>"And so you see, don't you, Lady Walmer,
that I really simply couldn't do it&mdash;I
mean I must do it. They're expecting me there
for the whole summer. How could I throw them
over at the last minute?"</p>

<p>Harry spoke in his most convincing voice. He
was calling on Lady Walmer, and they were
both sitting in her little yellow boudoir. She had
just come in from a bazaar, and was wearing a
rather angry-looking hat, very much turned up
on one side, with enormous purple feathers. She
was looking very far from pleased. Her handsome
chin appeared squarer than usual. There
was a look in her eyes that more than one man
besides Harry would have been by no means
anxious to meet.</p>

<p>She drew off her gloves, stroked one over the
other thoughtfully, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why did you promise to come on the yacht?
The whole summer's spoilt for Alec."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>"I hoped I could&mdash;I thought I could manage
it. Surely you understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it's got to come to that sooner or later,
Harry. You can't make an omelette without
breaking eggs. If you want to be a respectable,
dull married man, you'll have to dissolve your
romance, you know. I should have thought you
were the last person to be weak about anybody
else's feelings!&mdash;No, it's your own, my dear boy."</p>

<p>Harry's colour rose a little.</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Walmer! I'm going to tell&mdash;my
cousin Valentia&mdash;all about it&mdash;I mean about
my hopes. I'm certain that she will be charming
about it&mdash;only too glad, for my sake."</p>

<p>"Oh! And yet I thought she was human! Or&mdash;is
there some one else?"</p>

<p>"Certainly there's some one else&mdash;there's
Romer. She's very devoted to him."</p>

<p>"Harry, my boy, we should get on so very
much better if you wouldn't tell so many
unnecessary fibs," remarked the lady.</p>

<p>She stood up and drew the hatpins out of
her hat.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm quite frank with you. I don't
think I've been anything else. And, after all, I
only ask to do it in my own way&mdash;at my own
time. To choose my moment. Really, one can't
behave like an <i>impossible</i> bounder."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't one? Well, perhaps not."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>She took the hat off and put it on a table,
giving the impression suddenly, without it, of
being smooth, a little bald, and very good-tempered.</p>

<p>"Then you'll forgive me, Lady Walmer&mdash;you'll
understand? I should think that in about
three or four weeks I shall be able to join you
somewhere. But, about fixing the date&mdash;that's
impossible. Can't I see Alec to-day?"</p>

<p>She smiled graciously.</p>

<p>"Certainly you may; I want you to. You must
cheer her up and say nice things to her. Poor
child, I wish she weren't so ridiculously pleased
with you. You don't care two straws for her."</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honour that I will
make her happy."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll make her as happy as any
one would. It's always something to get one's
wish, even if the wish is a failure."</p>

<p>"Now, why do you say that? It won't be a
failure."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll send her to you. Now be a
good boy, Harry. I'm jealous&mdash;for Alec&mdash;of the
Green Gate." She smiled in her attractive way.
"Will there be an absolute rupture between you
and your ... cousins, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, good heavens, Lady Walmer, no!" said
Harry rather irritably. "We shall all be perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>friends, of course ... what impossible things you
expect."</p>

<p>"I expect only what is certain."</p>

<p>She went away.</p>

<p>Vanity was as elemental in Harry as in any
other good-looking young man. With him,
though, it was not a mere useless pursuit&mdash;an
art-for-art's-sake joy&mdash;but invariably calculated
and used as a means to an end.</p>

<p>He looked in the glass earnestly, then started
as Alec came in.</p>

<p>He was always surprised and even a little <i>g&ecirc;n&eacute;</i>
each time he saw her, by her immense apparent
height. It seemed so much greater than it was
because of the somewhat monotonous lines of her
figure and her rather bird-like face.</p>

<p>Harry watched her, listened to her as she
chattered away her hurried, inexpressive unmeaning
slang, and looked at him with her
bright, small, beadlike eyes.</p>

<p>He did not appreciate her. He did not know
that behind the jerky manner and inexpressive
face there was a Soul.</p>

<p>She had not been trained to talk sentiment,
and she could not express her ideas; so, though
she adored Harry, she only said to her mother in
confidence, when in a serious mood, that he was
all right; and when in a more playful frame of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>mind to her girl-friends, that he was a little
<i>bit</i> of all right.</p>

<p>"Alec," he said, making her sit down in the
lowest chair (he could not bear her towering
over him), "isn't it a bore that I can't come on
the yacht?"</p>

<p>"Pretty useless," she answered.</p>

<p>He took her hand.</p>

<p>"You won't forget me while I'm away, will
you, Alec?"</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think?" she answered in a
trembling voice, and then gave a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!"</p>

<p>"Will you be just as nice when I see you
again?" continued Harry, in a carefully-modulated
voice.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me all this rot?" she said,
with another uneasy laugh. "Of course I shall."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>Harry couldn't think of anything else to say.
Then he remembered....</p>

<p>"When I join you again I'm going to bring
you a ring. What's your favourite stone?"</p>

<p>"Rubies and diamonds," she answered without
a moment's hesitation. "I say, how sporting
of you! That'll be ripping!"</p>

<p>He tried to feel touched by her artless joy. He
knew he was not an ideally ardent suitor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>"Well, we'll have a good time later on, eh?"
he said in her own tone.</p>

<p>"Don't be a silly ass!" replied the girl, her
eyes full of tears and tenderness, and her heart
of the most sincere joy and affection.</p>

<p>Harry laughed.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Alec, is your mother a soothing
companion? Is she a nice woman to live with?"</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>she's</i> all right. A bit <a class="ins" href="#tnote_3"  name="tAnchor_3" title="of colour">off colour</a> sometimes.
At least&mdash;well, she <i>is</i> all right, if you
understand&mdash;and yet she's <i>not</i>&mdash;if you know
what I mean."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is a dark saying. You are pleased to
be mysterious&mdash;sphinx-like."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a rotter, Harry!"</p>

<p>"How subtle you are, Alec. How elusive is the
lightning-play of your wit!"</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> much?"</p>

<p>"The random poppy of paradox grows too
often in the golden cornfield of your conversation,"
Harry went on, taking her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" exclaimed the artless girl. "Can't
make out what you're driving at half the time,
when you go on like that. Don't believe you
know yourself."</p>

<p>"Don't I? Really now, you know, we're
almost&mdash;well&mdash;privately engaged. May I kiss
you, Alec?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>She blushed crimson, turned her face away,
and said, "Please yourself."</p>

<p>Unable to help laughing, he kissed the top of
her head, told her to write to him, and left the
house, feeling like an entirely new and recently-discovered
kind of bounder.</p>

<p>He hated the double game. It didn't amuse
him a bit. But now he felt he was free for a
month's holiday, during which he had, however,
the unpleasant holiday task of breaking the
news to Valentia.</p>

<p>He was driving home, but changed his mind
and called out to the cabman to drive to
Valentia's house.</p>

<p>He found her trying on furs&mdash;furs in mid-summer!</p>

<p>She greeted the arrival of his exquisite discrimination
and taste with clapped hands, soft,
beaming eyes, and her smile&mdash;Valentia's smile.
Miss Walmer couldn't smile at all&mdash;she didn't
know how. She could only laugh.</p>

<h3>MRS. FOSTER</h3>


<p>Daphne had come to say good-bye to Mrs.
Foster.</p>

<p>This lady lived in a kind of model cottage in
a garden in Ham Common. It was not at all like
the ideal, 'quaint' model cottages that one sees
advertised by well-known firms of furnishers,
though it might have been. Mrs. Foster was
rebellious to Waring, and sincerely disliked anything
modern.</p>

<p>The little drawing-room, and indeed every
other room in the house, was principally furnished
by photographs and groups of her son Cyril&mdash;Cyril
as a very plain boy, in a skirt, with hardly
any eyes or hair, and a pout; Cyril as a 'perfect
pet' of a sailor, at six. Then Cyril in cricketing
groups (how he stood out against the other
ordinary boys!)&mdash;in Etons (looking neat and
supercilious), and then in his uniform, in which
he looked simply lovely.</p>

<p>Daphne had an intense and growing desire to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>please his mother. In fact, curiously, she was
more anxious to gain her approbation than that
of Cyril himself. To this end she usually remade
her hats, when possible, in the train on her way
to Ham Common, and her pocket when she
arrived there was usually filled with artificial
flowers, feathers, or other ornaments that she
had taken off her hat, so as to look simple. Also
she turned it down all the way round to make
it look as if it were merely a protection from the
sun&mdash;not a hat.</p>

<p>To-day she wore a pink-spotted muslin dress
and a straw hat, with pink ribbon. She certainly
looked extremely pretty, and not at all what she
had such a dread of before Mrs. Foster, smart.
Mrs. Foster had a horror of smartness in the
<i>jeune fille</i>.</p>

<p>Daphne delighted her. She was a very sentimental
woman, with a strong theoretical bias
for the practical. She was by way of teaching
Daphne housekeeping and how to manage on a
small income (of which art she knew very little
herself, but was supposed to know a great deal
because she wore a kind of cap). She had a
pretty, delicate, kind face, and was wearing large
wash-leather gloves, in case she should wish to
do a little gardening later on.</p>

<p>Daphne had still much of the child in her, and
there was nothing she enjoyed quite so much as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>gardening with Mrs. Foster, and occasionally
stopping to eat a gingerbread-nut, and hear
something about Cyril and the brilliant remarks
he had made as a child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster had a chiffonnier of a kind Daphne
had never seen before, which fascinated her
because such queer delightful things came out
of it in the middle of the morning&mdash;slices of
seed cake, apples, and the gingerbread-nuts.
There were pink shavings in the fireplace, and
wherever there was not a photograph of Cyril
there was one of the Prince Imperial. Evidently
he had been the passion of Mrs. Foster's earlier
life. She loved to tell the story of how she had
seen him at Chislehurst, and how she thought
he had looked at her.</p>

<p>There were other nice things in the cottage:
there were two rather large vases of pink china
on which were reproduced photographs of Cyril's
great-uncle and great-aunt&mdash;one in whiskers,
the other in parted but raised hair with an
Alexandra curl on the left shoulder. In these
vases folded slips of paper called spills were kept.
A modern note was struck by the presence of a
baby Grand&mdash;a jolly, clumsy, disproportioned
youthful piano, rather like a colt, on which
Daphne played Chopin to Mrs. Foster, and
sometimes The Chocolate Soldier to Cyril; and
Mrs. Foster, at twilight, sometimes played and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>even sang, "<i>I cannot sing the old songs, they are
too dear to me,</i>" which her mother used to
sing, or, coming a little nearer to the present,
"<i>Ask nothing more, nothing more, all I can give
thee, I give,</i>" a passionate song of the early
eighties.</p>

<p>No one, except Daphne, ever did ask any more.</p>

<p>The whole thing was, to Daphne, a treat.
Something in the atmosphere of Ladysmith
Cottage&mdash;that was its name&mdash;fascinated and
amused her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster was a widow. Her husband had
been a distinguished soldier. Almost the whole
of her extremely small income had been devoted
to Cyril's education, and with the assistance
of an uncle who took interest in him, he had
been got into the Guards, where he existed
happily with a comparatively small allowance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster had not been at all surprised or
annoyed at his wishing to marry at twenty-two.
She thought it extremely natural. It seemed
to her very sensible of Daphne to accept
him, and that she was the most fortunate girl
in existence.</p>

<p>"I hope your sister doesn't mind my taking
you away from the gay, fashionable world for
a day?" she archly asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no, of course not. We're going in the
country next week, so I wanted to see you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>"Cyril's at Aldershot. I don't think he'll be
able to come down this afternoon. He can't get
away this week, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I shall see him before I go," said Daphne.</p>

<p>"Do you have a letter from him every day,
darling?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, a few lines."</p>

<p>"He is a noble boy!" said Mrs. Foster enthusiastically.
"How he always hated writing
letters! I remember how I guided his little hand
to write his first letter to his uncle, General
Rayner. Just as we got to the end of the letter
Cyril suddenly jumped up and threw over the
table. The letter was simply drenched in ink.
Dear boy! I've got it still.... Oh, you must
come into the garden, Daphne. I've something
new to show you. A friend of mine has just
let her house. She didn't know what to do with
her dovecot&mdash;nobody wanted it&mdash;so she's given
it to me. Come and see the dear little creatures&mdash;they
are so pretty."</p>

<p>They went out into the garden and stood
looking at a sort of depressed pigeon-house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster made strange noises, which she
thought suitable to attract the inmates, and
Daphne saw two doves who struck her as if
they had married in haste and were repenting
at leisure.</p>

<p>"Why don't you let them go free?" suggested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>the girl. "Just think how happy and delighted
they'd be."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. I don't think they'd know what
to do with their freedom. They're not used to
my garden yet, that's what's the matter. I do
wish they would coo; perhaps they will a little
later on." (This was a favourite expression of
Mrs. Foster's.) "I want to see one perched on
your shoulder, Daphne. It would make such a
pretty picture."</p>

<p>"I'd rather give them something to eat,"
said Daphne.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster started.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course. I fed them all yesterday
afternoon, but I forgot about them this morning.
Henry! Henry!"</p>

<p>The smallest boy appeared that had ever been
called by that name.</p>

<p>"Henry, feed the doves."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Then bring the watering-can. We're going
to water the flowers."</p>

<p>Henry, who seemed of a morose nature, went
to obey.</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to have a boy for the knives,
and he acts as a gardener when I'm busy,"
explained Mrs. Foster. "There isn't much of a
kitchen garden, only a few gooseberries and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>apples, as you know, dear, but it's nice to think
they grow there, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Of course, I can't make much show with
them. Henry always eats them before they're
ripe, which is <i>rather</i> hard. But he's a good,
honest boy. One of his sisters has gone in for
making blouses&mdash;in the village, you know.
She's a brave girl, and I feel sure will get on."</p>

<p>"She must be! Have you ever ...?"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>no</i>. Of course not. <i>I</i> couldn't. When a
woman reaches a certain age, my dear, a certain
style is necessary. I don't mean great expense,
but simple little things that would suit you,
darling, wouldn't do for me. Now that little
pink thing that you're wearing&mdash;I should look
<i>nothing</i> in it, and yet I dare say Henry's sister....
Where did you get it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>came</i> from Paquin's," said Daphne.
"It's not new."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, we mustn't be always talking of
chiffons together, that's very frivolous. You're
fond of poetry, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Not so very," said Daphne truthfully.</p>

<p>"But you would like to hear mine; I know
you would, dear," said Mrs. Foster, nodding,
and patting her hand. "Dear girl, you shall.
I've got a tiny little volume, all in manuscript.
It's quite a secret, darling. Hardly any one&mdash;now&mdash;knows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>that I was poetical. But I can tell
you anything&mdash;you're so sympathetic. I had
at one time a great wish to be a sort of&mdash;not
exactly Elizabeth Barrett Browning, or Christina
Rossetti&mdash;you know who I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>"But a singer of songs&mdash;songs of feeling.
Well, let us go into the garden. I will show it
to you later."</p>

<p>They sprinkled a few dead flowers, picked
a few weeds, and then Mrs. Foster became
thoughtful, took off her gloves, and went to her
room and remained there for some time. She
came down with a manuscript book in her
hand. It had a shiny cover, and in the right-hand
corner a piece of the cover was cut out.
On the paper, showing through, was written
in Mrs. Foster's delicate handwriting, "Fireflies
of Fancy."</p>

<p>"This," she said, patting it, "is my little
book, and after lunch I'll read you some of the
poems, dear Daphne, though I'm not at all sure
that all of them are quite suitable for you to
hear."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Foster!" Daphne found difficulty
in believing it.</p>

<p>"You see," continued the delicate-looking
old lady, in her sweet, refined voice, "I was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>very much under the influence of the Passionate
School&mdash;Swinburne, Rossetti, Ella Wheeler
Wilcox, and so on&mdash;at the time that I wrote.
My husband never wished me to publish them.
He didn't like them&mdash;he didn't understand
them. I don't mind admitting to you, dear, that
since I lost him I have sent one or two of the
less&mdash;well&mdash;shall we say strongly coloured?&mdash;poems
to the magazines at times, of course under
a <i>nom de plume</i>. But they were all returned.
I think they were considered too&mdash;well, too&mdash;&mdash;However,
I've given up the idea of making a
name as a poetess now, and very rarely show
them to anybody; <i>very</i> rarely."</p>

<p>Daphne answered, with absolute sincerity,
that she was dying to see them.</p>

<p>After lunch, when they retired to the little
drawing-room, Mrs. Foster sat down with her
back to the light, and a slight flush on her cheek,
and took up the book.</p>

<p>Daphne sat in a low little crimson arm-chair
exactly opposite her, clasping her knees, her
brown eyes fixed with the greatest interest as
Mrs. Foster turned and turned the pages as if
unable to select a suitable verse.</p>

<p>Then she began to read, in her soft, yet rather
high voice, which seemed suited only to gentle
greetings and adieux, or quavering orders to
Henry.</p>

</div></div>

<p>She stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear. I won't read this. Wait a
minute. I remember now that was the one that
was returned because it was too&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;I'll
find you another one."</p>

<p>"Oh, do finish that one," said Daphne,
"please! Isn't the light too much for your eyes?"</p>

<p>She jumped up quickly and pulled down the
blind an inch or two, and then came back,
having controlled herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster looked at her rather sharply, and
took no notice of what she supposed was emotion.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think this is quite&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster looked at her.</p>

<p>"You have a great deal of sensibility, Daphne.
I believe you have tears in your eyes."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't really." She turned away her
head, nearly choking.</p>

<p>A loud knock was heard at the front door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"It's Cyril!" she exclaimed. "He's got away
after all. Quick! Quick!" She threw the book
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>under a cushion and sat on it. With trembling
fingers she took up some needlework out of a
basket.</p>

<p>"Not a word&mdash;not a word! Go and meet him
in the hall, dear. He's come to give us a surprise.
I'll wait."</p>

<p>Blushing and laughing Daphne ran downstairs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>ENGAGED</h3>


<p>Daphne and Cyril sat in the garden
together. The conditions seemed ideal.
It was a lovely afternoon; the sun was hot, but
a gay irresponsible little west wind stirred the
trees; bees hummed industriously, butterflies
darted casually about among the few flowers,
and even the reticent doves cooed from time
to time, condescendingly. Peeping through the
blind Mrs. Foster thought the two young people
made a perfect picture, and was reminded of
the Golden Age. Indeed, they had very much
the charming, almost improbable air of the
figures in a Summer Number of an illustrated
paper. Perhaps the conditions were too perfect:
the lovers had, of course, nothing to sit on but
a rustic seat&mdash;Mrs. Foster would have thought
it a crime to have anything else in a garden, and
rustic seats are, no doubt, picturesque, but they
are very uncomfortable; they seem to consist of
nothing but points and knobs, gnarls and corners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>When Daphne was alone with Cyril like this
she felt contented and peaceful at first, and then
she began to wonder why she wasn't happier
still&mdash;why she didn't feel ecstatic. She was
proud of Cyril; he looked very handsome in
flannels, his regular features, smooth fair hair,
small head and small feet all added to his
resemblance to the hero in the holiday number.</p>

<p>Cyril said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear little girl!" and took her hand.</p>

<p>She laughed and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear old boy!"</p>

<p>Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jove! you do look ripping, Daphne."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Jolly being here like this, isn't it?" said
Cyril.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" she answered.</p>

<p>"Jolly day, too."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it lucky I was able to get away?"</p>

<p>"Rather."</p>

<p>"It was a fearful rush."</p>

<p>"It must have been."</p>

<p>"Jove, it is hot!"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Darling!"</p>

<p>"Dear boy!"</p>

<p>"May I smoke a cigarette, dear?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>"Yes, do."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette, and then put his arm
round her waist.</p>

<p>"Don't, Cyril."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked, removing it.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Henry or some one might
see."</p>

<p>"What's Henry?"</p>

<p>"A sort of gardener boy&mdash;the boy whose sort
of sister makes kind of blouses in the village."</p>

<p>"Oh, does he matter?"</p>

<p>Cyril was wondering if he could ask for a
drink.</p>

<p>When they were left entirely alone, on purpose
to be free, he always felt rather shy and
awkward, and intensely thirsty.</p>

<p>Daphne began to think about what time it
was, and about her train back&mdash;subjects that
never occurred to her when she was alone with
Mrs. Foster.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall soon have to be going,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! What, the moment I've arrived?"</p>

<p>He tried not to feel a little relieved. He
wondered why he hadn't more to say to her. He
had been desperate to get consent to their engagement,
and was always extremely anxious and
counting the minutes till they met, and when
they were together, alone after much elaborate
scheming, he felt a little embarrassed, and, like
his fianc&eacute;e, was surprised he wasn't happier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>"I say, Daphne!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"You do look sweet."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>"Simply ripping! I say!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Won't it be jolly when we're married?"</p>

<p>"Yes; lovely."</p>

<p>"It will be all the time just like this, you
see&mdash;only nicer ... I say! Isn't it hot?"</p>

<p>They sat holding hands, he looking at her
admiringly, she feeling mildly pleased that such
a dear, handsome boy should be so fond of her.
In the minds of both was another sensation,
which they did not recognise, or, at all events,
would not admit to themselves. They both,
especially Cyril, counted the minutes to these
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>, and immediately afterwards looked
back on them with regret, feeling they had
missed something. They wrote to each other
frequent, short, but intensely affectionate letters
about the happiness these interviews had given
them. Yet, while they actually lasted, both
Cyril and Daphne, had they only known it,
were really rather bored. The next day, or the
same evening, Cyril would write to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My own Darling,&mdash;How jolly it was having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>you a little to myself to-day! And to think that
you really care for me!" and so on.</p>

<p>And she would enjoy writing back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearest,&mdash;Didn't we have a heavenly time
in the garden yesterday?" and so forth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As a matter of fact, they had not had a
heavenly time at all; when he kissed her, which
he sometimes did, she did not really like it,
though she knew she ought, and it gave her
a sort of mental gratification to think that he
<i>had</i> given this manifestation of love, as she
knew it was considered the right thing.</p>

<p>He did not really regard her as a woman at
all, but more as a lovely doll, or sweet companion,
and it pleased his vanity immensely to
think he should be allowed this privilege,
which at the same time seemed to him a little
unnecessary, and even derogatory to her,
though he enjoyed it very much too, in a somewhat
uncomfortable way.</p>

<p>The fact that their engagement was so
indefinite, that they had hardly any hope of
being married for at least two years, perhaps
added a little to the <i>g&ecirc;ne</i> of these meetings.
The instant they were separated he began to
long to see her alone again. Daphne felt sure
she must be really in love because she took
comparatively little interest in anything that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>was not more or less connected with the idea
of Cyril. Perhaps she enjoyed the things she
associated with him more than his actual presence.
Talking about him to Valentia, or
hearing about him from his mother, seemed
more amusing and exciting than sitting with
him alone and holding his hand. She would
have liked best never to see him except in
evening dress at a party, only to hear about him
or think about him all day.</p>

<p>Cyril was sure that his feeling was real love,
because he did not care two straws how hard up
they should be when they were married, and
because if he heard any one sing a sentimental
song, however badly, he immediately thought
of her with the greatest tenderness. He believed
he missed her every moment of the day, and he
took great trouble to see her, especially when
there was a chance of their being alone. But, as
a matter of fact, he was rather glad when Mrs.
Foster came out into the garden; and when he
had seen Daphne off at the station, although it
was a pang to see her go away without him, it
was perhaps also a slight relief.</p>

<p>When Val came to meet her at the station,
full of news about the extraordinary number
of exciting things that had happened in the day,
and they dashed back to dress for a dinner
Harry was giving before going to a dance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Daphne felt a tinge of sentiment and regret for
the idyllic happiness in the garden, and began
to count the hours until they should meet alone
again. The glamour always returned an hour
or so after they had been separated.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>AT THE CARLTON</h3>


<p>With characteristic amiability, combined
with that courage which had caused
impatient people, who snubbed her in vain, to
say she had the hide of a rhinoceros, Miss
Luscombe had accepted the blow of Rathbone's
proposal&mdash;the proposal which she had taken for
an offer of marriage, but which was really an
offer to go on the stage. She set to work at once
making little efforts (most of which she knew
to be futile) to arrange the matter. After all,
if she should succeed in getting him some sort of
a part, mightn't he, out of gratitude?... And
she saw visions. Again, he had evidently got it
very badly, this mania for acting and dressing
up, and he had really quite enough money, if
he chose to devote it to this object only; why
shouldn't he take a theatre&mdash;make himself the
manager and <i>jeune premier</i>, or, for the matter
of that, <i>vieux dernier</i>&mdash;it really didn't matter&mdash;and
let her be the leading lady? That was if he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>failed in every other scheme. She wrote letters
to various people whom she knew on the stage,
mentioning Rathbone's enormous willingness
to take <i>anything</i>, his gentlemanly appearance,
and, she felt sure, really <i>some</i> talent, though
no experience. Most people took no notice, but
after a while she received an offer for him to
play one of the gentlemen in the chorus of <i>Our
Miss Gibbs</i> in a second-rate little touring company
of the smaller northern provincial towns.</p>

<p>It was an excuse for an interview, certainly;
but this for a man who wished to play Romeo!
And if, in his enthusiasm, he should actually
accept it, it would take him away from her.
However, hearing that she had some news for
him, he, in his delighted gratitude, asked her to
tea at the Carlton.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They were seated in the Palm Court eating
their tea-cakes and sandwiches to the sound of
"The Teddy Bear's Picnic," which made one
feel cheerful and reckless, followed by "Simple
Aveu," a thin, sentimental solo on the violin that
made one feel resigned and melancholy. It was
played by a man with a three-cornered face and
a very bald head, who gazed at the ceiling as if
in a kind of swoon&mdash;a swoon that might have
been induced either by tender ecstasy or acute
boredom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>All around them were noisy Americans, neatly
dressed, and a good many prim, self-conscious
ladies on the stage who had come on from their
<i>matin&eacute;es</i> and were accompanied mostly either
by very young and rather chinless adorers, or
by fat, fatuous men with dark moustaches, hair
inclined to curl, and clothes a shade too gorgeous.</p>

<p>Here and there a simple, provincial-looking
family were to be seen who had come up for a
few days and had been to an afternoon performance,
and were talking with great animation
of the rights and wrongs of the hero and heroine
of the play. It was characteristic of the provincials
that they were really excited about the play
itself, hardly knowing who were performing,
while the suburbanites took interest only in the
actors, all of whom they knew well by name and
reputation, even their private life&mdash;at least, as
much of it as got into the <i>Prattler</i>, <i>The Perfect
Lady</i>, and <i>Home Chirps</i>.</p>

<p>On the whole it was a very characteristic
London crowd, in that it consisted almost
entirely of desirable aliens. Here and there,
indeed, one saw a thin, slim, pretty woman with
a happy but bothered-looking young man, both
obviously English, who talked in low tones, and
were evidently at some stage or other of a rose-coloured
romance; but they were the exception.</p>

<p>Amidst this noisy and confused client&egrave;le, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>its showy clothes and obvious feminine charms,
Miss Luscombe looked a strange, stray, untidy
hothouse plant. She was odd and artificial, and
dressed like nothing on earth, in pale and faded
colours; but she was not vulgar. She was rather
queer and delicate, and intensely amiable. Her
self-consciousness made no claim on one; she
was not exacting&mdash;always pleased and good-tempered.
Rathbone recognised these qualities
in her, and liked her better to-day, amidst the
scent of the tea-cakes and cigarettes and the
whine of the violin, than he had ever liked her
before.</p>

<p>Pink, fair, calm, clean, and really hardly anything
else, except extremely correct, and always
good form, without being too noticeably so, no
one would have dreamed that this quiet young
man, who looked like a shy subaltern, was
simply dying to disport himself on the stage, and
that it was the dream of his life to make an utter
ass of himself as Hamlet, or a hopeless fool of
himself as (say) the hero in <i>Still Waters Run
Deep</i>&mdash;a play he had seen as a boy and had
always longed to act in.</p>

<p>She had broken the news to him.</p>

<p>"Miss Luscombe, do you mean to say that is
the very best you can do for me?"</p>

<p>She explained the difficulties.</p>

<p>He was only one of so many! Unless the name
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>was known it was frightfully difficult&mdash;even for
geniuses&mdash;to get on. Of course, he might try,
and go and see the various managers himself,
but, frankly, probably nothing would come of it.</p>

<p>He was deeply depressed. What should she
suggest?</p>

<p>"Might I ask if you care very, very much?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"You might. I do." Yes. His heart was set
on it.</p>

<p>Was it really? Well, if he simply hadn't the
strength to go on living another day without
going on the stage, the only thing, clearly, was
just to hire a theatre and <i>go</i> on! A <i>matin&eacute;e</i>,
perhaps. Why not Romeo?</p>

<p>"And why not Juliet?" said he, rather rashly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be lovely!"</p>

<p>Her attention wandered at this moment. A
very pretty, fair woman was rising from behind
a palm where she had been seated with her back
to the room. She went out rather quickly, followed
by a good-looking young man with a single
eye-glass.</p>

<p>"They have been trying to hide!" she
exclaimed. "What a joke! It's that sweet Valentia
Wyburn and Harry de Freyne. They must have
been here when we arrived, for we should have
seen them come in. I wonder what they came
for?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>"To have tea, perhaps?" suggested Rathbone,
after deep thought, shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know. But why hide like that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they didn't want to be seen," said
Rathbone brilliantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but why not? I hope it
doesn't show...."</p>

<p>"Well, it shows there's nothing in it, or they
wouldn't come here."</p>

<p>"Does it?" said Miss Luscombe, rather disappointed.</p>

<p>"Well, where's the harm in being here? Ain't
we here?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course; but that's different.
They're cousins, too, of course; I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should worry if Romer
doesn't," said Rathbone.</p>

<p>Before they left Rathbone had very nearly
promised to see about engaging a theatre, and
either for a charity or as an invitation <i>matin&eacute;e</i>,
rope, as he expressed it, all his friends in, lock the
door, and force them to see him play Romeo to
Miss Luscombe's Juliet.</p>

<p>Flora was deliriously happy at the idea, but
had too much experience to rely on it, and was
quite prepared to be thrown over for another
more professional actress, and asked to play one
of the ladies at the ball in the first act instead,
probably in a mask. She went home and read
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>over her one good notice&mdash;a great treasure&mdash;that
had appeared in an evening paper, and had
spoken of her as "<i>a young actress with a bright
and winsome personality</i>." That was in a very
small part, ten years ago. Would she ever get
another real chance?</p>

<h3>AT MISS WESTBURY'S</h3>


<p>Mrs. Wyburn found Miss Westbury being
sensible and decided and holding forth
about things in general to one or two friends
over the tea-cups. Something in the way the old
lady sat down and unfastened her mantle, so as
to be sure to feel the benefit of it when she went
out again, made the other women present feel
that they were not wanted, and Miss Westbury
did not attempt to detain them. For (though she
would not have put it like that) she knew that
she would get more fun out of her friend's
<i>m&eacute;chancet&eacute;</i> if they were alone. Scandal, gossip
made tedious by morality, is only really enjoyable
<i>en t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>"I do so hope, Isabella, that you haven't had
any more annoyance about the silly things that
are being said about your pretty daughter-in-law,"
remarked Miss Westbury, leaning back
with the comfortable amiability of a fat woman
who expects to be amused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>Mrs. Wyburn looked round the room.</p>

<p>"Curious you never have your ceiling painted,"
she said. "I've often wondered why it is. It looks&mdash;you'll
forgive me for saying so, Millie, won't
you?&mdash;as if you left it in its present state from
motives of, may I say, economy? But, of course,
I know it isn't that&mdash;I always say, it's simply
that you haven't noticed it. Thanks, no&mdash;no tea."</p>

<p>Miss Westbury's serenity was slightly disturbed,
as her friend intended.</p>

<p>"I certainly don't spend my whole time lying
on my back looking at the ceiling," she answered
rather brusquely. "I have far too much to do."</p>

<p>"I never suggested that you should," quickly
replied Mrs. Wyburn. "Such a thing never
occurred to me for a single moment. And please
don't think I wish to interfere, or to make
remarks about anything that doesn't concern
me. It merely struck me that if, at any time, you
thought by some curious chance of having the
house done up, it might be a pity to leave out
the ceiling. But that was all. I do assure you,
Millie, I never dreamt of hurting your feelings."</p>

<p>Miss Westbury laughed with a rather cackling
sound&mdash;a sound Mrs. Wyburn recognised with
satisfaction. It showed just the degree of slight
annoyance she loved to cause in any one to whom
she was speaking. Miss Westbury, however,
waived the question and became hospitable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>"Do let me persuade you to have a toasted
bun. Our baker makes them in a special way on
purpose for me. There's nothing in the world
more sensible with one's tea than a small toasted
currant bun. I was speaking to Dr. Gribling
about it only the other day, oddly enough, and
he quite agreed with me."</p>

<p>"Why <i>only the other day</i>? and why <i>oddly
enough</i>, Millie?&mdash;I dare say you speak to him
constantly about it and about other equally
urgent matters." She spoke with what she
meant to be a slight sneer, in reply to which
Miss Westbury behaved in a manner that is
sometimes described as bridling up. She gave a
movement meant to be a toss of the head and
placed her lips firmly together.</p>

<p>"I like Dr. Gribling, Isabella, because he's a
thoroughly sensible man&mdash;a man you can say
anything to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn thought that Miss Westbury
would say anything to any one, and she shrewdly
suspected that Millie was probably the one gleam
of amusement in poor old Dr. Gribling's dreary
round. However, she waved the eminent
physician aside and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"About Valentia. She and Romer have gone
down to the country, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Quite early to go. Very nice.
Have they a large party there, do you know? The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>Green Gate is such a charming place&mdash;so
picturesque."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen it?" Mrs. Wyburn asked.</p>

<p>"Only in the <i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash;I mean accounts
of week-ends there, and that sort of thing. But I
believe it's quite charming. It seems almost a
pity though, doesn't it, at the end of the season
to begin the same frivolities and gaieties all over
again. I wonder they don't take a little rest."</p>

<p>"I believe they are resting. Valentia wrote to
me that no one was staying there at all, except,
of course, Daphne."</p>

<p>"And Harry de Freyne?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Mr. de Freyne."</p>

<p>"Strange," said Miss Westbury comfortably.
"Curious that extraordinary infatuation of your&mdash;son
for this young man. But he's a very
charming man, isn't he? Most agreeable?"</p>

<p>"He's not absolutely unpleasant."</p>

<p>"I suppose he brightens them up&mdash;amuses
them? Probably he has very high spirits. Perhaps
he has the <i>jar de veev</i>." Miss Westbury had a
private pronunciation of foreign expressions all
her own. "It is unfortunate, but do you know one
often sees that in unprincipled people, Isabella."</p>

<p>"He knows that he's not quite a gentleman,
and is trying to laugh it off," said Mrs. Wyburn.</p>

<p>"Does he really? Dear, dear&mdash;what a sad
thing!&mdash;and yet he certainly <i>ought</i> to be a gentleman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>you know. On his mother's side he is connected
with the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not the point," snapped Mrs. Wyburn.
"And of course I don't mean to say that&mdash;outwardly&mdash;he's
not. His manner and appearance
are distinguished. It's the soul that's vulgar."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see! You mean you're afraid he isn't
one of <i>nature's</i> gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Nature? How do you mean? He has nothing
to do with nature. He's a man about town."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;I understood he was
an artist. And sometimes, you know, artists are
extremely fond of nature; in fact, far <i>too</i> fond."</p>

<p>"I believe all that painting is only done to
throw dust in people's eyes&mdash;an excuse for
idleness. Candidly, I don't like studios; I don't
think they're respectable."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean; but still, after all"&mdash;Miss
Westbury made a feeble attempt at a good-natured
defence&mdash;"after all, if they all like it&mdash;I
mean to say, if they're all so happy, why should
we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I doubt if my son is happy."</p>

<p>"Oh, really, really? Do you think he's <i>ever
noticed anything?</i> Isn't he devoted to Harry de
Freyne?"</p>

<p>"Of course he hates him like poison," replied
the mother.</p>

<p>Miss Westbury started in delighted horror,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>and replied sharply, "How do you know that?
Did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"Tell me! He would never tell me. Besides,
he couldn't tell me&mdash;he doesn't know it."</p>

<p>"And how do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Mothers know everything," she replied.</p>

<p>After a minute's pause, Miss Westbury said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But if you feel sure that Romer isn't happy,
and that he, almost unconsciously perhaps,
doesn't really like this young man being always
about, mightn't it some day end in some
trouble&mdash;some explosion?"</p>

<p>"It's quite possible."</p>

<p>"Then I wonder what Romer would do?"</p>

<p>"I know what he would do."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Isabella, you don't mean to
say that he would ever bring a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's really strange," said Mrs. Wyburn, "that
at your age you should still be so silly. Will you
never learn to understand anything at all? Of
course not. He would protect her."</p>

<p>"Can't something be done? Why don't you
speak to Valentia?"</p>

<p>"The advice of a relative-in-law in a case of
this kind has never yet been known to be of any
real use, Millie. I can only hope the whole thing
may gradually wear itself out."</p>

<p>"May it be so, my dear!" echoed Miss Westbury,
unctuously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Mrs. Wyburn got up to go.</p>

<p>Miss Westbury helped her to fasten her
mantle.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you loosened it, or else you might
not feel the benefit of it when you go out,
Isabella," she observed, for she was not one to
miss an opportunity of making a remark of this
kind. "And <i>do</i> look on the bright side. I always
say that things of this sort may not be true, and
even if they are, everything may be for the best
in the end."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn liked to excite Millie's interest,
and yet somehow loathed her sympathy.</p>

<p>"Yes; do you know, I really <i>should</i> have the
ceiling painted, if I were you," she said, as if it
were a new idea. "Otherwise your house is
looking so nice&mdash;quite charming. I think it such
an excellent plan not to have flowers in the
windows, only ever-greens."</p>

<p>"So glad you think so. It <i>is</i> rather a good
arrangement, because, you see, they always
look exactly the same all the year round."</p>

<p>"That they certainly do&mdash;and nevergreens
would be a better name for them," spitefully
said Mrs. Wyburn to herself as she drove off.</p>

<p>"What a tiresome mood Isabella was in to-day,"
said Miss Westbury to herself. "I must go
and see Jane Totness and tell her what she
said.... Ceiling, indeed! She <i>was</i> nasty!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A PROPOSAL</h3>


<p>Miss Luscombe was looking out of the
window, looking up to the street, waiting.
At last she saw from her basement (the
"tank," as her friends called it) a glimpse
on the pavement of a pair of feet that she
knew. They were the feet of Mr. John Ryland
Rathbone. She hastened to prepare herself for
his visit.</p>

<p>It is obvious that people who live in a basement
must look at life from a different point of
view from all others. The proudest of women
in that position must necessarily see it <i>de bas en
haut</i>. The woman looking out of the drawing-room
or higher for the person she is expecting
to see gets more or less of a bird's-eye view. She
sees the top of a hat first, and the person
necessarily foreshortened. From the dining-room
or ground-floor window she sees the
approaching visitor through glass, but practically
on a level, almost face to face, and therefore is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>incapable of judging him on the whole or of
taking a very large view, since any object placed
close to the eye deprives one of a sense of
proportion&mdash;shuts out everything else. But
from a basement window things are very different.
It is wonderful how much character one
learns to see in feet, and it is still more curious
how, to the accustomed eye, their expression can
vary from time to time. Flora saw at a glance
by the obstinate stamp, the bad-tempered look
of his boots, by the nervous impatience of his
stride, that Mr. Rathbone was coming to see her
in a state of agitation. One would hardly have
believed that, without having seen his face at
all, she would be so prepared for his behaviour
when he arrived as to greet him anxiously from
the door, even before he came in, with "Good
heavens, what <i>is</i> the matter?"</p>

<p>"How do you know anything is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I guessed. I saw your steps."</p>

<p>"Everything is going wrong about the play.
The expenses get larger every day. To sell even
<i>one</i> ticket for a charity, they tell me, is simply
out of the question! I must invite everybody,
and even then most of them won't come. Just
think, my dear Miss Luscombe, all this trouble,
worry, and expense for amateurs to play
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> at an invitation performance
to an absolutely empty house!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>"Why do you think it will be empty?...
Your friends?"</p>

<p>"My friends? You're my only friend! Every
chap at the Club I have spoken to about it
said they would be out of town that day. One
or two said they would come on afterwards and
join me at supper. Supper! I said it was a <i>matin&eacute;e</i>;
so then they suggested I should give a dinner
afterwards. And even women, they're quite as
bad. I mentioned it to Lady Walmer. She is
always so keen on going everywhere, and makes
a hobby of odd charities and things. She said
she was going yachting that day, and also that
she was going to a wedding."</p>

<p>"What does it matter just about Lady
Walmer?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, but it's an indication. Do we want
to have no one in a theatre but the dressmakers
who made the costumes? Miss Luscombe&mdash;Flora!
I am beginning to think we'd better
chuck it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Rathbone! The waste and the disappointment!"</p>

<p>"It would be a greater waste to make an utter
fool of oneself in an empty house than to postpone
it. I'm nervous. I'm really frightened. I'm
beginning to see that I've been a fool. As to
disappointment, <i>that</i>, Flora, you could console
me for if you chose."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>"Oh, Mr. Rathbone!"</p>

<p>"You really have been so sweet, so patient,
it's my opinion that you are an angel!"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I'm not!"</p>

<p>"Well, you have the patience of one. You
never think about yourself. You're all kindness
and sweetness and thought for other people. To
speak perfectly frankly, you have only one tiny
fault, Flora. And that is, that you seem a <i>little</i>
artificial. But it's my opinion that such affectations
as you have are natural to you and you
can't help them, and you would be an ideal
wife."</p>

<p>Flora was actually silent with gratification.
She did not even laugh.</p>

<p>"Look here, Flora, we'd better chuck the performance
altogether. Let's give it up, and have
a show instead at St. George's, Hanover Square."</p>

<p>"Are you making fun of me?" she asked, in
a trembling voice, "because that would not be
right. It wouldn't be nice of you&mdash;in fact, it
would be rather cruel."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you care for me the
least little bit?" He took both her hands and
stared hard at her face. "Is there something
real about you then?" he continued.</p>

<p>Tears came to her eyes. She turned her head
away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>"This seems too good to be true," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Let's be married," he cried, "on the day we
were going to have the show. Let's go to Oberammergau
for our honeymoon, and don't let
us ever go near the theatre again. Will you,
dear? Or am I dreaming?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I always have," she answered ingenuously;
"but I hadn't a scrap of hope, and
I didn't know how much I cared for you."</p>

<p>"Dear Flora, I shall give up the stage and
devote all my time to you."</p>

<p>"So will I," she said. "I shall never want to
act again."</p>

<p>"Nor I, never&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"I shall rush home and countermand everything,"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, go not yet; it is not yet near day," she
quoted in the tender voice she used for recitation.</p>

<p>He burst into peals of laughter, and put his
arms round her and kissed her impetuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Flora, what a fool I have been all this
time! And you knew it&mdash;you knew it perfectly
well. I thought when we were rehearsing that
once you said the words, 'O Romeo, wherefore
art <i>thou</i> Romeo?' with rather marked emphasis
<a class="ins" href="#tnote_6"  name="tAnchor_6" title="on the 'thou.'&quot;...">
on the 'thou'...."</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>"Do you know that I never cared for any one
but you in my life, Flora?"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Why is 'C. L.' tattooed on your
wrist?"</p>

<p>"I'll have it taken out. I'll have Flora put
on instead. I'll have anything you like tattooed
in your honour&mdash;a hunting scene, a snap-shot
of the Coronation&mdash;anything you like."</p>

<p>"No, please not. I don't like it; I can't bear
it. It's the only thing I ever haven't liked about
you. But we'll forget it now, won't we?" she
said.</p>

<p>"And I'll forget the stage. Oh, Flora, how I
have worried you! Forgive me. We won't
think of anything but each other now."</p>

<p>They repeated this sentiment again and again
in these and other words for about an hour and
a half, and forgot to turn up lights and ring the
bell.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The first real love scene Flora had ever acted
in was a triumphant success.</p>

<h3>HEREFORD VAUGHAN</h3>


<p>To have eleven plays, all written out of
one's own head, and all being performed
simultaneously in American, in Eskimo, and
even in Turkish, besides in every known European
language; to have money rolling in, and
the strange world of agents and managers
pursuing you by every post and imploring for
more contracts by every Marconigram; and
these triumphs to have come quite suddenly,
was really enough to have turned the head of
any young man; yet Hereford Vaughan's
(known by his very few intimate friends as
Gillie) had remained remarkably calm. He was
not even embittered by success.</p>

<p>To know his jokes were being got over the
footlights of so many lands was a curious sensation,
and it often made him laugh suddenly to
reflect how wicked certain quips must sound in,
say, Japanese. Perhaps his friends were rather
inclined to resent the way he retained his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>balance after what was really an almost unheard-of
hit. They would have been readier to
pardon it had he shown some sign of boring
fatuity; or perhaps they thought he might at
least have had a temporary nervous breakdown;
taking the form (for choice) of losing all sense
of the value of money and wildly throwing
bank-notes and gold at every one he saw. But
he remained quiet, reserved, and as apparently
modest as ever.</p>

<p>Modesty is a valuable merit (as I think
Schopenhauer has discovered) in people who
have no other, and the appearance of it is extremely
useful to those who have, but I am not
suggesting that Vaughan was not human, and
there was, no doubt, many a moment when he
smiled to himself, and felt that he was a great
man.</p>

<p>He was rather secretive and mysterious than
blatant or dashing, and this, of course, made
him, on the whole, more interesting to women.
The fact that he had made a fortune and lived
alone in a charming house with nothing but
housekeepers, secretaries, telephones, typewriters,
and cooks, of course made all the women
of his acquaintance who had the match-making
instinct (and what woman has not?) desire to
see him married. As he showed no sign of doing
so, they tried to console themselves by pretending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>that he had some secret romance. Old ladies
hoped he had a broken heart for some fianc&eacute;e
who was lying under the daisies, having died of
decline in the classical middle-Victorian way.
Young ladies thought that he was probably
fixed up in some way that would be sure in
time to dissolve, and that he would marry later
on. Far the most popular theory was that he
didn't marry simply because he <i>was</i> married,
privately; and that he had, no doubt, hurriedly
espoused, before he was of age (and before the
Registrar), some barmaid or chorus-girl, or
other dreadful person, who had turned out far
too respectable to divorce, and that he was thus
a young man marred. They had no grounds for
the rumour except that clever and promising
young men often did these things, and he had
always been a particularly promising young
man, and in this unfortunate case had probably
kept his promise.</p>

<p>Vaughan was sitting one morning reading
his notices (never believe the greatest men when
they tell you that they don't do that!), when
Muir Howard came cheerily, almost boisterously,
into the room. He was an old school
friend who had been devoted to Gillie long before
his arrival, and of whose faults, virtues,
cheeriness, and admiration Vaughan had made
a confirmed habit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>Muir was a very good-looking barrister, with
vague parliamentary ambitions and a definite
love of machinery. He always had pink cheeks,
and wore a pink carnation, and looked as flourishing,
gay, and yet, somehow, battered, as Vaughan
looked pale, fresh, and sardonic. One of the
things that surprised the general public was
that Vaughan could not live without the continuous
society of a person who certainly could
not understand a word he wrote or much that
he said. They didn't realise that Vaughan was
so accustomed to not listening to Muir's long
confidences, to disputing every proposition he
made, and contradicting every word he said,
that he always felt lost when his friend was
away. Muir regarded him as a combination of
hero, genius, pet, and child, and was always
giving him advice and imploring him not to
do too much. To Vaughan he was, as I have
said, a habit, and there is always something
agreeable in a habit of which one is a little
tired.</p>

<p>He had arrived this morning on his bicycle,
and came in bringing a whiff of heartiness, self-complacency,
and fresh air, saying, "Hallo!
hallo! hallo! Priceless to find you in, Gillie!"
All he got for it was that Vaughan looked up
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You used to be only breezy. Now you're
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>becoming a thorough draught. Fold up and
keep quiet, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Nervous, I suppose," said Muir, in a sympathetic
voice. "I wonder you don't take that
stuff that you see in the papers about what is
good for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sudden pains in the back on washing-day,
bending over the tub, and so forth? The portraits
of the people before taking the remedy
and after decided me. It seems, by the pictures,
to make your hair grow long and give you
whiskers and a ghastly squint. Ruins your
clothes, too. Your collars get the wrong shape."</p>

<p>"Oh well, leave it alone, then. Perhaps you're
right.... You haven't asked me about the
Walmers' dance. I took Miss de Freyne to
supper. The American chap never turned up,
and I was getting on with her simply rippingly,
when <i>what</i> do you think she said? Confided in
me that she was privately engaged to and
frightfully keen on that boy you met at Harry's.
The baby Guardsman. Isn't it sickening?"</p>

<p>"What did Miss Walmer do?" asked Vaughan.</p>

<p>"She sort of hung about, waiting for Harry,
who seemed to be getting on all right with the
two strings to his bow, or two stools, or two
bundles of hay, or whatever it is. What luck
some people have!"</p>

<p>"Not in this case. He'll lose them both."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>"Really? Why?"</p>

<p>"He's not a diplomatist, and he wants such
a lot for himself. He wants too much. No self-restraint."</p>

<p>"Pretty useless for Mrs. Wyburn. I like her.
She looked topping last night, too. But I dare say
it'll be all right. Romer's a good chap. Awfully
dull."</p>

<p>"Most interesting. Are you going to stay here
much longer, Muir?"</p>

<p>"Why? Yes."</p>

<p>Vaughan got up.</p>

<p>"All right. Do. I'm going out."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>Vaughan did not answer, but gave the heap
of notices to his friend, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just divide the sheep and goats for me, will
you? That's just what they are, the critics&mdash;either
sheep or goats."</p>

<p>"Of course I will. But, I say&mdash;I came here to
have a talk."</p>

<p>"I know you did. You have talked."</p>

<p>He went out. Muir smiled to himself, enjoying
this treatment as an eccentricity of genius.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Gillie came back.</p>

<h3>GILLIE INTERFERES</h3>


<p>He was not much surprised to find Muir
proudly examining the invitation cards
on the mantelpiece. Muir started and turned
round as he came in.</p>

<p>"Back again? Capital!"</p>

<p>"Well, of all the snobs!" said Vaughan.</p>

<p>"Hang it, Gillie, it's only for you. I'm pleased
you're getting on, that's all."</p>

<p>"No words can tell you how I despise your
point of view. Just tell me something I want
to know. Wasn't there a sort of little scene at
this dance last night?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see anything," he answered.</p>

<p>"You never do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember now, I heard something. It
appears that Romer left his wife and Daphne
at the dance and then came back in an hour to
fetch them, and she wasn't there."</p>

<p>"Who wasn't where?"</p>

<p>"Val and Harry had gone for a little fresh air
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>in a taxi for about a quarter of an hour, that's
all. They came back and explained it."</p>

<p>"They would. Don't apologise."</p>

<p>"But just the few minutes that Romer was
looking for them made&mdash;well, rather a fuss. It
was perfectly all right afterwards. They all had
supper together. So there wasn't much talk
about it, except, as I say, while Romer was
waiting for them. I never in my life saw any one
look so ghastly as that chap did."</p>

<p>Vaughan sat down and looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Only you, Muir, would leave out the only
thing of the slightest importance that you had
to tell me, which I hear the second I leave the
house from that round-faced tattooed idiot,
Rathbone, at the corner of the street."</p>

<p>"But I tell you it's all right, old chap."</p>

<p>"All right? Don't you see that this sort of
thing constantly happening will gradually
undermine ...? I like Valentia. It's a great
shame."</p>

<p>"Harry certainly isn't worth smashing up a
happy home for," Muir answered, "if that's
what you're afraid of. But ... when he marries
Miss Walmer it'll be all right. Val will forget
about him, and settle down with Romer again.
I'm deeper than you think, Gillie ... ah, I
don't say much, but I can see as far through a
brick wall as most people!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>"Just about as far, I should think," said
Vaughan contemptuously.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do about it?"</p>

<p>"It's likely I'd tell you." Gillie sat down to
his desk and rang a bell.</p>

<p>"I suppose I've got to go now, eh?"</p>

<p>"Almost time, I should think."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Capital! Well, so long! Be
good."</p>

<p>Muir went away as heartily as he had arrived.</p>

<p>The bell was answered by the entrance of the
housekeeper, Mrs. Mills. She was a muddle-headed,
elderly woman in black silk, whom
Vaughan kept because her extraordinary tactlessness
amused him. She invariably managed
to do and say the wrong thing at the right
time. To-day it was a hot morning in July. She
came in holding in her hand a little card covered
with frost and robins.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vaughan, sir, I appened to be going
through my things, and I come across this, sir.
I thought pre-aps you'd like it. It is pretty."</p>

<p>She insisted on his taking it.</p>

<p>"Charming, Mrs. Mills, but I don't quite
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the words, sir! They're what I
call so appropriate! Do read them."</p>

<p>He read the beautiful words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Wishing you a blithe and gladsome Yule.</i></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>"What on earth&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I only thought they was pretty,
and pre-aps you'd like to keep it, sir, or send it
to one of your young ladies; but I'll take it
away if you don't like it." She put it back in her
pocket.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't. What a genius you have
for the wrong thing! Are you going to give me
plum pudding and turkey on Midsummer Day?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't dream of such a thing, sir."</p>

<p>Gillie had scribbled a letter.</p>

<p>"Go and ring up a messenger boy, will you?"</p>

<p>"May I send Johnson, sir? I don't old with
telephones. They buzz at you or makes you
jump. And the young person keeps on saying
ave you got them? before you've ad time to
breathe, in a manner of speaking."</p>

<p>She took the note. Vaughan sat down on a
sofa to wait for the answer, glanced at the clock,
and said, "Confound Muir! He's made me
waste another morning."</p>

<p>When the answer came, Gillie went out and
strolled towards Mount Street.</p>

<p>He found Valentia at home, evidently flattered
and fluttered at seeing him.</p>

<p>"How sweet of you to come!" she said.</p>

<p>"You'll stay to lunch, of course?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>"Oh! lunching with a leading lady, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>"With Romeike and Curtice."</p>

<p>"Not really? What fun! What are they like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Romeike is all right. I don't care so
much about Curtice."</p>

<p>She gave him a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I never in my life," said Vaughan, "before
to-day, attempted to interfere in anybody else's
affairs."</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>"But in this case it&mdash;may I really smoke?&mdash;does
seem such a pity! Of course you know what
I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>"You see, I feel so certain that if you were,
let's say&mdash;married to <i>Harry</i> and met Romer
after, you'd be so wildly in love with Romer."</p>

<p>"So I was," she said in a low voice. "Tremendously!
I thought he was a strong silent
man with a great deal in him.... Oh! I've
told you."</p>

<p>"Yes, but so he is. It's commonplace of you,
really, Val, not to see it."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry.... I do love Romer, and
I think I appreciate him. But somehow it's a
little dull. It's not exciting as I thought it
would be."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>"Well! if you <i>must</i> have fun, and amusement,
and make a hero of somebody, why just
Harry? Why not a superior man? Me, for instance?"</p>

<p>He was laughing.</p>

<p>"I've been told that an adoration for you
would be hopeless, utterly hopeless." She smiled.
"And we're friends. I can't imagine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor I. Of course I know it's utterly absurd
to come and give people advice on these subjects,
and one can't dispute about tastes and all that.
But my practical mind revolts to see any one so
delightful as you throwing away the substance
for the shadow. You see, I'm a mass of platitudes."</p>

<p>"Shadows are very attractive sometimes."</p>

<p>"But they go away too. And then where are
you?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"They do, really. I know what I'm talking
about." He stood up. "Think over what I've
said."</p>

<p>"You're kind, but you're rather depressing,
Gillie," said Val. She looked a little frightened,
but very pretty.</p>

<p>"When do you go back to the country?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to-day. We're there now. We only came
up for the dance. We're motoring down to the
Green Gate.... All of us."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>"Oh yes.... I'm afraid you must think me
very impertinent."</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't."</p>

<p>"And when I've gone you will give orders
that you're never at home to me again. But,
somehow, I couldn't help it. If it makes you
hate me to remember what I've said, forget it."</p>

<p>She laughed as he rose to go.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Gillie; but what I want to
know is, where you're really going."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, exactly. I'm going home to
lunch, because I've an urgent appointment
immediately afterwards."</p>

<p>"More plays, I suppose? What sort this time?"</p>

<p>"A light comedy, with a very slight love
interest," he answered, "all dialogue, no action....
At least, so far."</p>

<p>"Oh, then it isn't finished yet?"</p>

<p>"Not quite. Good-bye. And if you ever want
a change, remember&mdash;a <i>superior</i> man!"</p>

<p>They both laughed insincerely.</p>

<p>He left her looking thoughtfully out of the
window.</p>

<h3>THE BALD-FACED STAG</h3>


<p>Vaughan went home, and after lunching,
chiefly on a newspaper and a cup of coffee,
he got into a taxicab and gave a direction.</p>

<p>The vehicle flew smoothly along down Park
Lane, past the Marble Arch into the Edgware
Road, and on from there between houses and
shops, growing gradually uglier and uglier, to
Maida Vale, up Shoot-up Hill, and so on until
there was a glimpse of suburban country, and
gasworks, and glaring posters of melodramas on
hoardings, till it stopped suddenly at a real little
old roadside inn, straight out of Dickens&mdash;"The
Bald-faced Stag at Edgware." Edgware suggested
<i>John Gilpin</i>, Gillie's favourite poem.</p>

<p>Here he got out, and was positively welcomed,
and heartily, by a real roadside innkeeper&mdash;also
out of Dickens&mdash;resembling the elder
Weller&mdash;a local magnate called Tom Brill,
who looked a relic of the coaching days, though
really he never did anything but stand in front
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>of the inn in his shirt-sleeves and welcome
people.</p>

<p>Vaughan, obviously an habitu&eacute;, walked
through the inn into a perfectly adorable garden,
which was so large, so quiet, and so full of
pinks, hollyhocks, and other old-fashioned
flowers, so absolutely peaceful and sleepy, that
one could have imagined oneself miles away
in the country.</p>

<p>The garden belonged as much to the Dickens
period as the inn itself. It contained a great
many wooden arbours in which one could
imagine ladies in crinolines archly accepting
tea, or refusing sips of shrub (whatever that
may be) with whiskered gentlemen. There was
a large cage full of Persian pheasants with
gorgeous Indian colouring, which always suggested
to Vaughan&mdash;he didn't know why&mdash;the
Crimean War. There was a parlour covered
with coloured prints of racehorses and boxing
matches, and in which was a little round table
painted as a draught-board, and furnished with
a set of Indian chessmen of red and white ivory.
The whole thing, though only twenty minutes'
drive from Mayfair, was unknown, unspoilt,
and apparently had not altered in any particular
since about 1856. Its great charm was
that it was utterly unself-conscious; it had no
idea that it was quaint.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>Vaughan sat down on a rustic seat and
plunged into the atmosphere of the period that
he loved, revelling in the soothing, delightful
calm, and in the fact that nobody there knew
who he was (though they knew him well by
name), and that none of his friends and acquaintances
would have dreamt that he was
there.</p>

<p>A large field beyond the garden contained
cows, hay, and other rustic things.</p>

<p>Presently Tom Brill came up to him, and he
asked after Mrs. Brill, whom her husband
always described, with confidential pride, as
"Though I say it that shouldn't say it, as fine
a woman as you'll meet in a day's march."</p>

<p>Vaughan always assented to this proposition.
As he had never himself in his life been for a
day's march, and probably never would, he
certainly would have had no right to contradict
Mr. Brill on the subject.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Brill at home?" he presently asked.
"May I see her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, of course you shall. She's
helping her mother. I'll call her. Don't move,
sir, don't move."</p>

<p>Miss Brill, who had been helping her mother
to look out of the window, now came into the
garden, which immediately became idyllic.</p>

<p>She was not in any way like the innkeeper's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>daughter of Comic Opera. She was a schoolgirl
of sixteen, with a long, fair plait, a short serge
skirt, and a seraphic oval face. She ought to
have been called Fanny or Clara. Unluckily her
name was Gladys.</p>

<p>She said in a very sweet voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're quite a stranger, sir." And she
amplified the assertion by adding, "You haven't
been here not this ever so long."</p>

<p>"I know I haven't, but I've been longing to
come."</p>

<p>"Not you!" she said ironically.</p>

<p>She was standing opposite him, with her
hands behind her back. Without a hat, in the
glaring afternoon sun, with the complexion,
pale pink and white, of a china doll that had
never made up, she was a refreshing sight after
the theatrical world in London, not to speak of
society. Vaughan seemed to think so.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you enjoy the play?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"It was very kind of you to send us the
tickets. Mother enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"You didn't care much for the piece yourself?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was rather silly," she answered.</p>

<p>He had never had a criticism on his work
that pleased him more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>"I mean," she went on, "I shouldn't have
thought&mdash;well, nobody would go on like that."</p>

<p>"Go on how?"</p>

<p>"Why, go on so silly."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like to see another play,
written by the same man, then?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind another one. Wild horses
wouldn't drag me to see that again."</p>

<p>"Wild horses are not likely to try," he
observed. At which jest she laughed loudly and
charmingly, showing marvellous teeth. She had
no cockney accent, though she occasionally and
fitfully dropped an H.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gladys, do take me for a walk in the
field."</p>

<p>"Want to see the calf?"</p>

<p>"No; I can live without seeing the calf. I
want to sit in the field with you."</p>

<p>"You are a caution! Come on then, but I
can't stay long."</p>

<p>They climbed the gate, which she seemed to
think a quicker mode of entrance than sending
for the key, and sat in the field, from which
Mr. Brill always declared you could see three
counties. Perhaps you could; if so, they all
looked exactly alike.</p>

<p>"It's quiet here, isn't it? I shan't have much
more of it," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gladys! Don't say you're going away!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>"Of course I am. Don't you know I'm going
to be a manicure in Bond Street?"</p>

<p>"Bond Street? How revolting! Is that your
ambition?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think it would be very nice. I must
do something. Father's settled about it. First
I'm going to pay to learn it, and then I shall
earn quite a lot. It's a great <a class="ins" href="#tnote_7"  name="tAnchor_7" title="airdresser's">hairdresser's</a>."</p>

<p>"I think it's horrible, Gladys. Perhaps you'll
fall in love with a German hairdresser, and be
lost to me for ever."</p>

<p>"I shan't fall in love with no foreigners,
don't you fret."</p>

<p>"I'm not fretting. Will you have your hair
done up?" he asked, lifting the long plait.</p>

<p>"Well, of course I shall, and waved, and that."</p>

<p>"Gladys, they'll spoil you."</p>

<p>The conversation went on in this strain for
some time. She alternately repeated the exclamation,
"How you do go on!" or accused
him of the mysterious crime of being a caution,
but she never stopped looking perfectly beautiful
and seraphic.</p>

<p>When they went back to the garden a few
other visitors had straggled in. They all seemed
to come in high dog-carts, and they always
ordered eggs, jam, and watercress with their
tea, and were immensely impressed by the
Persian pheasants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Vaughan went back to London feeling refreshed,
and already, strangely, counting the
days till he could come back.</p>

<p>There was not a woman in the world he
knew whom he would have taken the slightest
trouble to see except Gladys, the innkeeper's
daughter. She was an illiterate schoolgirl; and
though she had a lovely face, she was stupid,
and probably not so angelic as she looked; but
he always felt a little disappointed as he drove
back. He wished she were in love with him.</p>

<p>And this ungratified wish was, in all his full
life with its brilliant success, perhaps his
greatest real pleasure.</p>

<h3>THE GREEN GATE</h3>


<p>When Harry came down to breakfast, a
little late, he found Valentia waiting
to pour out his coffee, and some letters on his
plate. She watched him as he opened them.
Most of them looked like bills. On the envelope
of one was a little blue flag. Harry put this
letter in his pocket, and went on eating.</p>

<p>"It's a lovely morning, Harry. So fresh;
just the sort of day not to do anything
at all."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's what's so delightful about you
all," he answered. "You never say, 'What shall
we do?' and neither of you have ever said yet
that this is Liberty Hall, which means, as a
rule, in a country house, 'Breakfast at eight
o'clock sharp, you won't mind it being a little
cold if you're late, and then we are going for a
motor drive at 9.30.' Still, I think, perhaps,
one ought to take a little exercise. I feel almost
equal to a game of croquet this afternoon&mdash;later
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>on&mdash;when I'm stronger. Is any one
coming down to-day?"</p>

<p>"No. And only Van Buren, and Vaughan and
Muir Howard on Sunday. I see you've heard
from the Walmers. What do they say?"</p>

<p>"It's sure to be nothing of interest. How I
love your hair parted on one side! It makes you
look like a boy."</p>

<p>"Not a principal boy, I hope. Why not read
the letter?"</p>

<p>Harry got up and fetched himself something
from the sideboard.</p>

<p>"I don't feel quite strong enough yet. When
I've had breakfast. I should like to paint you as
you're looking now, Val. I think I'll do a sketch
of you in the rose garden, all in black and white,
like a Beardsley, with the balustrades and steps
and things behind you. Will you sit to me?"</p>

<p>"That's all very well. But why don't you
read your letter?"</p>

<p>"There's sure to be nothing in it."</p>

<p>"How can you tell till you've opened it?"</p>

<p>"I know. I always feel what's in a letter
without opening it. Don't you? I absorb the
essence, as it were, through the covers of the
envelope, as somebody or other&mdash;Macaulay,
I think&mdash;used to absorb all the important things
through the covers of a book. Or wasn't it
Macaulay? Anyhow, it doesn't matter. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>some tiresome person whom one oughtn't to
talk about on a morning like this."</p>

<p>Harry evidently was not quite at his ease.</p>

<p>"But why not read it?" She spoke playfully.</p>

<p>"How persistent women are, just like children.
To tease you I just shan't."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!"</p>

<p>"I shan't read it now at all," he went on.
"I can answer it without reading it."</p>

<p>"It's only that I should like to know how the
Walmers are enjoying themselves on <i>Flying
Fish</i>. Lady Walmer was a little afraid they
mightn't like it."</p>

<p>Here Romer came up to the window and
called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Val, come here a minute. I want to
ask you something."</p>

<p>"Here I am, dear," and she vanished into
the garden.</p>

<p>The second she had gone Harry opened the
letter very carefully, and read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dearest Harry,</p>

<p>"You are a rotter never to write. I'm
having <i>such</i> a time. Weather priceless, but very
sick at not hearing from you. Algie Thynne is
here. Do you know him? He's rather a nut.
Wish you were here. No more to-day.
Bye-bye, old son.</p>

<p class="right">"Your loving "<span class="smcap">Alec</span>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>"P.S.&mdash;Do write. The moonlight nights are
simply topping. Just like a picture. I think
you'd like it; otherwise everything is beastly.</p>

<p>"I love you more than ever.</p>

<p class="right">"A."</p></div>

<p>He put the letter back in the untorn envelope
and carefully fastened it up again. He then
placed it on the mantelpiece, and having
finished his breakfast, lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Algie Thynne, indeed!" he said to himself.
"How pathetic, trying to make me jealous!
Well, it's a pretty letter, and what's more, it
must be answered."</p>

<p>Val came back.</p>

<p>"Romer wants the lawn mown," she said.
"He's perfectly mad on the subject of mowing the
lawn. He seems to think it ought to be shaved
every day. It's the only thing he knows about
the country. Well, have you read your letter?"</p>

<p>"There it is," said Harry. "You can read it
if you like." He watched her carefully as she
took it from the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I don't want to read it," she said, holding it.</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Harry, tell me honestly, wouldn't you
really mind if I tore it into little bits and put
it in the waste-paper basket&mdash;just as it is?"</p>

<p>"Not a straw," said Harry, shaking his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>She clapped her hands, tore it into tiny pieces,
and threw it in the basket. Then she said, in a
low voice of deep gratitude&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, you are sweet! Do forgive me."</p>

<p>"I don't see that there's anything to forgive,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is; lots. I'm afraid I've been horrid.
I'll never bother you about any thing again."</p>

<p>She was simply beaming.</p>

<p>"Good," answered Harry indifferently.</p>

<p>But as he followed her into the garden he
looked rather perplexed. He felt that this sort
of thing was not leading up very well to what he
would have to tell her soon. However, why
spoil a lovely day by thinking of it?</p>

<p>Like a schoolboy with his holiday task before
him, he put it off as long as possible.</p>

<p>Though he didn't own it to himself, and was
disdainfully amused at Alec's letter, still the
thought of Algie Thynne, moonlight nights
on the yacht, topping weather, and his own
neglect, gave him some cause for alarm. Algie
Thynne was <i>cribl&eacute;</i> with debts, and probably keen
on marrying for money. Contemptible young
ass! Why didn't he <i>work</i>? Harry despised him.</p>

<p>At the earliest opportunity (which, by the
way, did not arise until he had made an excuse
to go into the village, where he wrote at the
post office) the answer was sent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>Even Harry found the beginning of the letter
too difficult, so he always began (as Valentia
might have said) without a beginning, which
impressed Miss Walmer much more. Ever since
he had reached the age of discretion, which, in
his case, was at his majority, Harry had been
thoroughly trained in the habit of writing
letters that gratified the recipient enormously
without compromising the writer in the slightest
degree. The habitual dread of those <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>
of Don Juan&mdash;the breach of promise case and
the Divorce Court&mdash;had got him into the way
of writing the sort of letter that he would have
had no objection to hear read aloud in court.
Perhaps that was why the sentences were always
polished, and the meaning a little vague.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"... I don't speak your language, perhaps,
but I understand your letter, reading between
the lines. It came like a whiff of fresh sea air.
Yes, it would be delightful to be on board
<i>Flying Fish</i> now. However, no doubt Algie
Thynne&mdash;(<i>how</i> eloquently, by the way, you
describe him! putting all the complications of
his character and the dazzling charm of his
personality in a nutshell by the simple sentence
'<i>He's rather a nut!</i>')&mdash;amply compensates for
my absence. You ask if I know him. I do,
though perhaps more by reputation than anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>else. We have met once or twice. Where?
I can't quite recall. Perhaps at the Oratory, or
at the Supper Club or some place of that sort.
But somehow I never pursued his acquaintance,
nor did it ever ripen into friendship. I felt,
instinctively, that he was too clever for me.</p>

<p>"I trust all the same that his brilliance will not
altogether overshadow your memory of <i>others</i>. I
should not like to think that we were drifting apart.
Still, if it should be so, I must resign myself.
I could still be happy in thinking of you, Alec.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'Love that is love at all</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Asks for no earthly coronal'</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but, I remember, you once expressed to me your
opinion that <i>all poetry is rot</i>. So I will not bore
you with quotations. It is pleasant here, and my
cousins are very kind, and leave me alone to
think as much as I like. I'm not, somehow,
quite in the mood for the usual gaieties and
frivolities of a country house. Last night we
played Musical Chairs until two in the morning,
and to-day I am a little weary. Your postscript
gave me joy. I need not say that I reciprocate it,
need I?...</p>

<p>"I feel all that you are feeling, and somehow
even know what you are doing, and if you did
not write again until we meet, I should not be
anxious. I have a trusting nature. But when you
wire, remember that the telegraph boy has a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>good way to walk, and when telegrams arrive
after midnight, it causes a sensation and much
inquiry. Also I cannot help feeling that every
one in the village, as well as at the Green Gate,
has read the words I would like to keep to
myself alone. I have a curious love of mystery&mdash;isn't
mystery the great charm of all romance?&mdash;So
to gratify this fancy of mine, sign your next
telegram 'Johnson.' I know you won't mind.</p>

<p>"When we meet again, all, I trust, will be
clear and definite before us. Best love to dear
Lady Walmer, and to yourself what I am sure
you will know. Don't be angry with me for not
writing oftener. I find it very difficult to express
my thoughts, for alas, I have no command
of language. Not only that, the pens here have
one great fault&mdash;they won't write. Otherwise
they're quite excellent.... Yes, your note has
given me, as the French say, 'furiously to think.'</p>

<p>"Hoping that all will go well with you, and
looking forward, think me as always,</p>

<p class="right">
"Yours, faithfully,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Harry Broke de Freyne</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>"There! that ought to keep her quiet for a
month," he thought as he posted the letter,
and with a sigh of relief turned back towards
the Green Gate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>A SUNDAY AFTERNOON</h3>


<p>By this time Van Buren was entirely in
Harry's confidence; that is to say, Harry
had gradually trained him to bear without
flinching the situation as Harry represented it.
He believed Harry had a hopeless romantic
affection for Mrs. Romer Wyburn which he was
trying to stifle, and that Miss Walmer being
hopelessly in love with <i>him</i>, he was doing his
best to marry her, partly, as he candidly admitted,
on worldly grounds.</p>

<p>Van Buren was deeply touched at Harry's
trust in him, and was always trying to keep him
up to his good resolutions by pointing out that
any understanding (however Platonic) between
the pretty Valentia and the handsome guest was
dishonourable, a breach of hospitality towards
Romer, that silent but admirable host.</p>

<p>Indeed, he repeated to Harry so often and so
firmly, "It can't be done; one can't make love
to the wife of a friend," that Harry was driven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>to the point of replying that he hardly saw
whom else, as a matter of fact, one <i>could</i> very
well make love to; it being impossible to have
romances with people one didn't know. And in
this case the fact that Harry was very fond of
Romer made the temptation far greater, as he
explained; Harry being (as he pointed out) so
very sensitive and highly strung that he could
never, somehow, be really attracted by a woman
whose husband was not sympathetic to him.
Which point of view Van Buren, shaking his
head, regarded as unsound.</p>

<p>Harry now spent much time giving picturesque
sketches and impressions of his feelings
to his friend, for he had an almost feminine
love of talking over personal affairs to the
sympathetic. In his benevolence Van Buren
longed to protect Valentia and Romer, and to
give Miss Walmer all she wanted; but most of
all his idea was to save Harry from himself, so
he always accepted with alacrity invitations to
the Green Gate for altruistic reasons. Besides,
his desire to see Daphne, although she was now
becoming more and more remote to him, was
still persistent, if a little less vivid.</p>

<p>"I've had a beautiful womanly letter from
Alec to-day," Harry confided in Van as soon as
he arrived. "You know the sort of thing she
writes: all in jerks and subaltern's slang. With
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>sincere sentiment showing between the lines.
And I answered it."</p>

<p>"A beautiful manly letter, I hope? I'm sure
you could do that as well as any one, Harry."</p>

<p>Harry smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, just some vague, cautious slosh, not
unamusing in its way&mdash;it'll <i>get</i> there all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, Harry, I know, but I do hope&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
Miss Daphne, how beautiful your England is
looking to-day! In America we never have a day
like this, warm and yet cool, with all those nice,
white, fleecy clouds in the sky. Our atmosphere
is always so hard and clear. Now this garden with
those large trees is just like a Corot. They <i>are</i>
fine trees. Poplars, I presume?"</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> presume," smiled Daphne; "I don't
know what they are, but I'm perfectly sure
they're not poplars."</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;I'm wrong. They're oaks, I've no
doubt." He hummed, "'The oak and the ash
and the bonny ivy tree.' Do let's walk over and
look at them closer, Miss Daphne."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't. Tea's ready."</p>

<p>To his annoyance Van was obliged to follow
Daphne and join the group round the tea-table.
He declined with some formality of manner to
accept the glass of iced water Daphne offered
him, and looked at her with that look of tender,
fixed, respectful reproach that had the effect of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>irritating her very nearly to the point of incivility.</p>

<p>She turned to Muir Howard, who was looking
very pink and cheery. Muir was a popular man
for his great ease in making conversation, the
kind that is as the pudding part in a plum pudding,
and without which the plums, however
delightful, could hardly stick together. Though
the great majority of people talk commonplaces,
their banalities are by no means always the
kind that help. Muir's particular way of opening
open doors, flogging dead horses, and
genially enjoying any spark of fun in his friends,
coupled with his good looks and pleasant, hearty
disposition, made him a most useful and welcome
guest, as a sort of super. He was quite decorative,
and could be turned on to talk newspaper politics
to dull men, pretty platitudes to plain women;
to make himself generally useful, and altogether
to help things to go. In this way he was invaluable.
Young girls always liked him; he was a great favourite
with elderly ladies, and with men of his
own age also, who were, however, occasionally
bored with his worship for his friend Vaughan.
He found it very difficult not to mention Gillie
less than once in every five minutes.</p>

<p>That distinguished young man, who was beginning
to look a little jaded with incense, was
engrossed with his hostess. Whenever he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>there Harry always became particularly devoted
in his manner to Valentia, and scarcely ever
left her other side. This was one of the reasons
that she enjoyed Gillie's presence, besides that
she was, now that she knew him well, particularly
fond of him. His conversation and personality
in general had a special flavour.</p>

<p>Every one was talking and laughing with the
light intoxication produced by tea and cigarettes
in the open air on a fine Sunday afternoon,
excepting only Romer, who as usual said hardly
anything, absorbed in admiration of his wife.
He suddenly remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Val. The Campbells are coming."</p>

<p>He wondered why this statement produced
a burst of irresponsible laughter.</p>

<p>"What fun! Will there be bagpipes?" Vaughan
asked.</p>

<p>"No, no. Romer means the Prebendary
Campbell, or at least his wife and daughter.
They're coming to see us this afternoon. I had
quite forgotten. Please all behave nicely.
They've been a long time making up their
minds. I believe they think we're frivolous."</p>

<p>"Not really? How could they? It reminds one
of the story of Henry James." Vaughan stopped
to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"It appears that for some time his near neighbours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>in the country looked a little coldly on
him on the grounds that, being a writer, he
must be Bohemian. At last the local doctor's
wife and clergyman's wife called on him, and
finding him perfectly respectable, stayed for
many hours. They were particularly tedious and
rather self-righteous. When they had gone, he
said thoughtfully to some one who was pitying
him for being bored, 'One of those poor wantons
has a certain cadaverous grace.'"</p>

<p>The story was well received, except by Van
Buren, who seemed painfully shocked.</p>

<p>Daphne, who had gone into the house to
fetch some snapshots, now came running back
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Val, Val! The Campbells are arriving in a
fly, and they seem to have brought their
foreigner with them&mdash;that man Miss Campbell
told me about. He's a kind of Belgian, and awfully
clever&mdash;he's invented something."</p>

<p>"What's he invented?"</p>

<p>"Brussels sprouts?" suggested Harry rather
sleepily.</p>

<p>"But they've been invented already."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he invent them over again?
Give him a chance."</p>

<p>Muir began to sing softly, "Young Lochinvar
has come out of the West," which he appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>to think a suitable serenade, but he stopped
suddenly at Gillie's entreaty.</p>

<p>"I don't mind anything Muir does, as long as
he doesn't sing," he always explained.</p>

<p>"It's awful hard lines. I've got a ripping
baritone voice, but I never have a chance to use
it," murmured Muir.</p>

<p>"You shall sing to me this afternoon. I'll
accompany you," whispered Daphne.</p>

<p>Muir had gratefully answered that it was
frightfully decent of her, when the servant
announced&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. and Miss Campbell. Mr.&mdash;&mdash;" He left a
blank, unable to pronounce the name.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Campbell introduced Mynheer von
Stoendyck.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Campbell was an amiable, colourless
woman, with a greyish brown fringe that looked
as if it were made of Berlin wool. Though she
was not yet forty-five, she wore a bonnet with
violet velvet strings, and had a very long waist.
Also, her skirt, in reality quite normal, looked,
to the eye used to contemporary fashion,
grotesquely wide at the end.</p>

<p>Her daughter was an ordinary Rectory girl,
spoilt by a dash of culture. At a glance all present
saw she was in love with Mr. Stoendyck. He was
a well-set-up man of about thirty-five, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>military manner and scientific eye-glasses, also
a turned-up light moustache. He spoke all
languages with one rasping accent, but Mrs.
Campbell seemed to suffer under the delusion
that he could only understand broken English.
So whenever people spoke to him she translated
their remarks into a sort of baby language that
seemed singularly out of place from her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you must think me dreadfully
worldly, calling on you on a Sunday," said Mrs.
Campbell, laughing socially as she sat down.
"But what the Prebendary always says is, the
better the day the better the deed."</p>

<p>"Oh, does he always say that?" Harry asked
with great apparent interest, waking up. He had
been overpowered with languor ever since lunch.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I felt sure you wouldn't mind our
bringing our friend, Mr. Stoendyck. He is so
clever. He's come over to England about an
invention."</p>

<p>Val thought of Brussels sprouts, but did not
suggest it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell apparently couldn't take her
eyes off the Belgian, whom she watched as one
watches a rather dangerous pet, though he
appeared particularly safe.</p>

<p>Muir, for an unknown reason addressing the
Belgian as Professor, was asking him his impressions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>of England. Mrs. Campbell bent forward,
and said with a nod&mdash;</p>

<p>"E ope you like it&mdash;Angleterre, you know"&mdash;and
nodded idiotically.</p>

<p>"I find it most interesting," said Mr. Stoendyck
raspingly, in admirable English. "There
are opportunities in this country for the
pursuance of science, art, and social intercourse
which one would hardly have expected. I do not
take tea, I thank you much."</p>

<p>"Have a glass of beer?" said Romer, suddenly
inspired.</p>

<p>Simple as the sentence was, Mrs. Campbell
thought it necessary to translate it with more
nods.</p>

<p>"E ask you, ave beer. <i>Bi&egrave;re</i>, you know! Glass,"
and then she went on in her usual tone, "Most
thoughtful of Mr. Wyburn, I'm sure. What a
charming place this is of yours, Mrs. Wyburn. I
always say the Green Gate is the most picturesque
place in the neighbourhood. And Mr. de
Freyne, I understand, is an artist. Do you know
my daughter, Marion, is <i>so</i> interested in art!
And my younger son, Garstin, though he is only
twelve years old, shows great artistic talent, too.
He did a map of Buckinghamshire that really
surprised me, almost any one would recognise it
at a glance. I always say I'm sure some day
Garstin will be in the Royal Academy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>Van Buren had approached and began to talk
to Mrs. Campbell. Val went over to the Belgian,
but she heard the American beginning a sentence
as usual with, "Pleased to meet you. I've never
had the opportunity of mixing much in clerical
circles in New York, Mrs. Campbell," and felt
sure he was going to ask impossible questions
about Prebendaries and Rural Deans.</p>

<p>The rasping Belgian, on whom both the
mother and daughter cast continual anxious and
admiring eyes, though he seemed thoroughly
able to take care of himself, said to Muir, who
was taking him on&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I do not spend my entire time over my
invention. Mrs. Campbell is so kind as to take me
for drives in the environment, to give me a right
impression of the beauties of Hertfordshire. For
relaxation I play the piano."</p>

<p>"Ha! <a class="ins" href="#tnote_8"  name="tAnchor_8" title="musical,">
Musical,</a> eh, Professor?" asked Muir
shrewdly. "That's right; so am I. I'm awfully
keen on music." He spoke reassuringly.</p>

<p>Mr. Stoendyck looked at him through his
glasses, and said without interest&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed. I find Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,
even on the piano, extraordinarily satisfying and
refreshing to the mind after the strain of looking
at English scenery." He drank a long draught of
iced lager.</p>

<p>"Oh! Classical, eh? I'm not up to that. Queen's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>Hall, eh? That sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon? Is there&mdash;&mdash;Has the
Queen a hall in this neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Professor?"</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, who managed to hear through
her own conversation with Van Buren, called
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"E say e no understand," and nodded smilingly,
seeming to think she had helped matters
considerably.</p>

<p>Miss Campbell talked of tennis, matins, hats
and the opera to Daphne, but appeared to be
absent, and occasionally smiled at the foreigner,
who ignored her.</p>

<p>At last the Campbells and their Belgian withdrew,
Mrs. Campbell saying that the Prebendary
wished them to go to Evensong. Their departure
left, as such visits do, a blank and a reaction. Our
friends were silent for a minute.</p>

<p>Then Vaughan said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel crushed, and a little flattened out, too."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> feel as if my brain were made of cotton
wool," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Come and sing," suggested Daphne to Muir,
and they went off to the drawing-room, from
which strains were soon heard about <i>It IS not
because</i>,&mdash;something or other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>In the middle of the song Daphne played a
wrong note, stopped, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish Cyril was here!"</p>

<p>"So do I. If he can accompany, I wish he was
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, go on!"</p>

<p>"<i>It IS not because thy heart is mine</i>"....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The party in the garden listened with a
worried expression.</p>

<p>"How about croquet?" suggested Val. "The
tapping noise will take it off."</p>

<p>"Yes. Come on."</p>

<p>"You can't," said Romer. "The lawn wants
mowing."</p>

<h3>IN THE ROSE GARDEN</h3>


<p>"How lovely this place must look at dawn!"</p>

<p>"By Jove! That's an idea, Gillie," said
Harry. "It must look glorious."</p>

<p>They were sitting in the rose garden with
Valentia. It was still quite light, though the
sunset glow had nearly faded. There was a rich
mellow tone in the sky, a promise of peace, a
feeling that it was the end of the day, which,
combined with the almost cloyingly sweet scent
of the roses, was enough to make any one feel
poetical.</p>

<p>"To think we've never seen the sun rise here!"
exclaimed Valentia.</p>

<p>Romer here joined them, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Hasn't Romer ever seen the sun rise here?"
Vaughan asked.</p>

<p>"Never," said Romer.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose because it always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>happens after I've gone to bed," he answered
drily.</p>

<p>"Let's sit up all night and see it to-morrow,"
suggested Valentia.</p>

<p>"Yes. Capital! Do let us!" said Harry.</p>

<p>Romer did not appear much taken with this
scheme.</p>

<p>"Oh no, you mustn't <i>sit</i> up," said Vaughan.
"That's not the way to see it."</p>

<p>"Is there so much difference between staying
up and getting up then?" Val asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, all the difference in the world.
You must get up fresh, with the birds."</p>

<p>"What time do birds get up? Is it <i>very</i> early?"</p>

<p>"It would do if you were out at three this
time of the year, or even at four."</p>

<p>"Well, let's do it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think I shall," said Harry.</p>

<p>He looked at Valentia.</p>

<p>She answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"You might make a sketch, you know, of the
early birds getting up to catch the worms. But&mdash;I
don't think I shall. Anyhow, not <i>to-morrow</i> at
<i>half-past three</i>."</p>

<p>"All right," said Harry with a nod, "we won't.
Don't tell Daphne, or she'll be out at 3.15 to the
tick, to take a snapshot of the dawn."</p>

<p>"A snapshot of the dawn! Wouldn't that be
sacrilege?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>"Young girls are always inclined to that.
They're so prosaic," said Harry, getting up. "I
must go and see what Van is doing."</p>

<p>He walked away with his usual quick, supple
step and casual bearing. They watched his slim
figure as he went. Then Romer followed him,
slowly.</p>

<p>Vaughan turned to Valentia and said: "I
shouldn't if I were you."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't what?"</p>

<p>"Why, meet Harry at half-past three to-morrow
morning in the rose garden."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! I never thought of doing such
a thing. Besides, it was your idea.... As a matter
of fact, I really assure you it wouldn't be here. It
would be in the orchard if anywhere. There is
the loveliest cherry-tree there, with a seat all
round it."</p>

<p>"How jolly! I'd like to see it. Will you give
me the key?"</p>

<p>"Who told you it was kept locked?"</p>

<p>She looked rather annoyed.</p>

<p>"You did, but not intentionally."</p>

<p>"I don't see that you have really any right to
suppose&mdash;&mdash;Why shouldn't I go in my own
orchard, at any hour I like?"</p>

<p>"But, Val&mdash;of course you ought to go in your
own orchard. But why don't you meet Romer
there?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>"Oh, Gillie, really!..."</p>

<p>"He is so straight, so good-looking, and, under
all that manner, he's exactly like Vesuvius. Yes.
Fancy, you're living with a volcano and you
don't appreciate it!"</p>

<p>"Gillie, it's really rather stupid of you to put
things like that. It isn't a question of liking
either one person <i>or</i> another. If Romer were ill,
or anything like that, don't you <i>know</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you'd devote yourself to him, like a
sister or a mother. You'd put Harry aside for a
time as a pleasure that mustn't be indulged in.
Now that's just where you're wrong. No! <i>I</i> want
to see you being ever so good and kind to dear
Harry as a duty to a ne'er-do-well of a cousin;
and regarding Romer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"My point is," he went on, "that it's really
too distressingly conventional of you to suppose
that because you happen to be legally married
there can be no sort of romance. Only comradeship,
or perhaps affectionate sentiment? That's
what you believe."</p>

<p>"Isn't it always so?"</p>

<p>"Most often, I grant. That's generally through
the man's point of view. But Romer is an exception.
He's as much in love as if he had no hope
of ever being within a mile of you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>She seemed rather flattered. "Do you really
think so? But even that isn't everything."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a great deal to be done with
Romer," was Vaughan's reply.</p>

<p>He spoke with dreamy significance, and she
was silent. Then she exclaimed, turning round
suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose what you really mean is that
Harry doesn't care a bit about me?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. But he cares a bit about a lot of
people, and things. He's superficial, and he has
no courage."</p>

<p>"No courage? <i>Harry!</i>"</p>

<p>"He'd crumble up in a crisis if a strong man
took him in hand."</p>

<p>"That's all nonsense." She was growing
angry. "Hasn't he been up in an aeroplane, and
done&mdash;oh, all sorts of things? I call Harry
daring and brave!"</p>

<p>"That's all vanity. All that is show and vanity.
Oh, Valentia, do forgive me."</p>

<p>"I'll try.... here he is."</p>

<p>He was seen coming towards them again.
Her anger flickered out at once.</p>

<p>"I suppose he thinks we've been here long
enough," she said, smiling as women do at such
symptoms.</p>

<p>"Of course he does. Vanity&mdash;just vanity."
Vaughan strolled away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>"Look here! What were you two talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. About you, Harry."</p>

<p>"Rubbish. What was he talking about?"</p>

<p>"You, only you."</p>

<p>"I can't see that that chap's so brilliant! It
seems to me he's just like anybody else. And his
work shows it too, really. No soul, no real heart
in it. All from the outside."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Harry, nobody is more kind-hearted,
more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Val, I won't have it. Do you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Have what, Harry?"</p>

<p>He lowered his voice. "I won't have it. You
must go back. It isn't that <i>I</i> mind. But Romer
will soon think it extraordinary, your sitting
out alone so long."</p>

<p>"No, he won't."</p>

<p>"All right then, he won't. He must be an
ass," said Harry angrily. "I don't know what
he's thinking of. Hasn't he got eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course he has."</p>

<p>"And eyelids too," said Harry. "I dare say
he pretends not to see that Vaughan admires
you. Too indolent to bother about it."</p>

<p>"Really. Harry&mdash;you go too far. Are you
thinking of pointing it out?"</p>

<p>She got up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>"One second," said Harry pleadingly. "It's
cruel of you to go now."</p>

<p>"I thought you said we'd better get back?"</p>

<p>"Your hands look so lovely by this light," he
spoke in his softest voice.</p>

<p>"We really must go."</p>

<p>"Then at half-past three. I'll bring my
sketchbook. Do you know where the key is?
Perhaps you've lost it. You are so dreadfully
careless." He now spoke in the tone of a reproving
husband.</p>

<p>"I've got it. Do you think we'd better? I'm
rather tired. Shall you be able to wake?"</p>

<p>Harry turned away.</p>

<p>"All right, it doesn't matter, Val. I shall be
going soon, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She followed him quickly.</p>

<p>"No, no, Harry. Of course."</p>

<p>He gave her a grateful look. They joined the
group on the little verandah in front of the
house. Van Buren was sitting in the corner and
seemed in the depths of depression. From the
windows could be heard once more strains of
music. Daphne was playing an accompaniment.
Muir had again begun the song, and got a little
further into it&mdash;"<i>It is not because thy heart is
mine, mine only, mine alone.</i>" But Vaughan
came up promptly and stopped it.</p>

<h3>SEEING THE SUN RISE</h3>


<p>What a delicate air there was in the
garden! There had been a little rain in
the night, but Valentia supposed it to be dew.
Every little sound seemed the softest music, to
the sound of which little dainty things seemed
to be dancing in the air. The Green Gate, a red
Georgian house, seen in the early glamour with
all its blinds down, except one, seemed like a
thing half asleep with one eye open.</p>

<p>For a moment she was a little frightened. He
was late. She had perhaps got up for nothing.
But no, it was worth it. It was lovely here.</p>

<p>Another eye of the house slowly opened, and
soon Romeo, or Paolo, or Faust, appeared.
True, he was disguised as a flannelled fool, with
a sketch-book under his arm. But it <i>was</i> Faust,
or Romeo, or Paolo, all the same. He looked
very handsome. The thought of scoring off
other people in the house had raised his spirits
and had even made him wake up in time.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>Valentia's conversation with Vaughan, whom
she knew to be honest and believed to be
brilliant, had left a certain insidious influence
on her which would tell gradually, and yet
their talk had had rather a contradictory effect
for the moment. She wanted to prove to herself
that he was wrong. And Harry felt that his
time was growing short. Very soon he must put
an end to it all.</p>

<p>This thought made him more affectionate. It
occurred to him for a moment that he would
tell her in the orchard; but, of course, he didn't.
Every day he thought he would tell her, and
something always happened to prevent it.
Besides, there would have to be a quarrel anyhow
at the end, so why make it longer than
necessary?</p>

<p>They sat down under the cherry-tree.</p>

<p>"Fancy you, Valentia, a minion of the moon,
rising before dawn! Let me look at you. You
fill me with wonder and joy."</p>

<p>"Did you mind getting up <i>very</i> much,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> rather hard. Listen!... That's a
thrush, making a scene with another thrush in
the tree."</p>

<p>"Is it? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is! How do <i>you</i> know things?
How did you know exactly what to wear, Val?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>I knew you had clothes for every possible occasion;
but still, to choose the <i>exact</i> right dress to
put on to meet your cousin at dawn in the
orchard seems&mdash;well, rather extraordinary.
Pinkish blue&mdash;or is it bluish pink?&mdash;to match
the sky. How jolly! It fastens in front."</p>

<p>"Well, of course I couldn't expect Ogburn to
get up in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"And no hatpins for once, thank goodness."</p>

<p>"Well, if we <i>sat up</i> till now I shouldn't be
wearing a hat, should I?"</p>

<p>"Don't argue. It's too early."</p>

<p>"It isn't really early. It's very late."</p>

<p>"Oh, Val! You're being logical."</p>

<p>He took her hands and looked at them, and
quoted&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>They are pale with the pallor of ivories,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But they blush at the tips like a curved sea-shell.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, Harry!"</p>

<p>He was thinking. He looked almost miserable.
"I don't see&mdash;I must admit&mdash;how I shall ever
be able to leave your hands!"</p>

<p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Why should you? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I only meant I couldn't...."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"What's that?... Some one coming along
the lawn."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>"Doesn't it sound curious?" she said&mdash;"so
<i>rustly</i>!"</p>

<p>"Who can it be? Surely your friend Vaughan
couldn't get up at this hour."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Of course not. They're coming
here." She jumped up.</p>

<p>"Go and open the gate at once," said Harry,
giving her the key. "I'll wait here a minute."
While she obeyed he used a good deal of language.
He now felt that he would give all he
possessed to keep her there five minutes longer.</p>

<p>"Fancy! It's Romer!" exclaimed Valentia.
"He hasn't seen me yet."</p>

<p>"Go to him at <i>once</i>. Tell him you got up to
see the sun rise. I'll come directly and join you.
Oh, confound it! <i>Do</i> look sharp. Seem pleased to
see him." He spoke in a harsh tone of command.</p>

<p>She ran to meet Romer, saying jokingly,
"Fancy meeting you!"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be here. I went to your
room and found you were out. Thought I'd get
up early."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad. <i>Isn't</i> it lovely and worth seeing
here? Come and pick some fruit in the orchard."</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i>! Harry's devouring gooseberries.
He's sketching the sky."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't Harry come?" said Romer.</p>

<p>He had no expression, and it was always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>impossible to guess by his looks or his tone what
he was thinking or feeling, except when he
smiled.</p>

<p>"Here he is."</p>

<p>Harry joined them.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, old boy! Who in the world&mdash;!
What on earth made you come out so early?"</p>

<p>Romer now smiled and looked at Valentia
admiringly.</p>

<p>"Gardener's not up yet. Thought perhaps I'd
mow the lawn," he said apologetically.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>"REPLY PAID"</h3>


<p>Valentia had been hurt at the tone in
which Harry had given his orders, and
turned from him to help to find the mowing-machine.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look jolly at sunrise? All that
pink and mauve in the sky tones in so well. It
seems to suit her. That's how she really should
be painted," said Harry, in the tone of an artist
admiring his model. "Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Romer.</p>

<p>"She looks like a golden rose," Harry went
on. He wanted to please Val, who he saw was
annoyed with him, and to emphasise the openness
of his admiration to Romer. "Doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said her husband.</p>

<p>Harry felt the morning was spoilt and the
situation absurd. He could not bear to be thwarted
in any way. He went back to his own room,
bounced angrily on to his bed, and went to sleep
again, after having seen Valentia through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>window helping to push the mower, and saying
to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"How like a woman! I shall go up to town
with Van Buren and send a wire to Alec."</p>

<p>This was his revenge.</p>

<p>Their momentary fears about Romer were
completely dissipated. He seemed exactly as
usual. As a rule he was even-tempered. Not
many people had seen him put out, though he
could be very angry, except with Valentia.
During this day he seemed, for him, a little
irritable. Perhaps, Val thought, through getting
up too early.</p>

<p>Harry went up to town with Van Buren for
the day, intending to return the same evening.
He soon recovered himself in the course of
copious confidences in the train. As soon as he
had arrived in London he began to count the
minutes before he should go back.</p>

<p>Valentia expected the elder Mrs. Wyburn to
lunch.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with her to-day?" Val
asked Daphne. "She must be kept in a good
temper, because it's the last time she'll come
down before going to Bournemouth. It's rather
a pity they've all gone. Romer is sure to say the
wrong thing to her&mdash;let out some trifle that
we have been carefully concealing for months&mdash;praise
up Harry, or something."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>"Doesn't she like Harry?"</p>

<p>"Since he went to see her she likes him for
herself, but not for me."</p>

<p>"What cheek! But he's not here."</p>

<p>"No, if he were she might like him again all
right. Then, Romer talks too slowly for her.
Her mind works quicker than his, and one can
only deal with him by racing on in front, and
turning round to beckon. With Mrs. Wyburn
there are only two things that are any use&mdash;dash
and volubility. It's difficult to keep the
thing going when she's alone with us."</p>

<p>"Well, why not pass the time this afternoon
by returning the Campbells' visit, and take
Mrs. Wyburn with us to 'The Angles'?" Daphne
suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh no! It's treating them almost like royalty
to go so soon. And there's the Belgian man."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she like Belgians then, Val?"</p>

<p>"I've never asked her. Only, don't you see, it
isn't that but the Belgian is what Harry calls a
blighter&mdash;a beano-blighter; and so is Mrs. Wyburn,
and it doesn't do to have two beano-blighters
in the same party."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see; they'd clash. What <i>is</i> a beano-blighter
exactly, Val?"</p>

<p>"A person who blights beanos. Who makes
every one a little uncomfortable, casts a gloom
over entertainments&mdash;has to be taken in hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>and dealt with separately from the others&mdash;doesn't
blend, you know."</p>

<p>"You mean some one who isn't the life and
soul of the party?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. That's almost as bad in its way.
In fact, the life-and-soul-of-the-party person
casts almost as great a gloom on the rest as a
blighter."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Yes, I see."</p>

<p>"We must meet her at the station in the
motor. I shall put on my blue serge and my
plain sailor. She mustn't see me in the garden
without a hat, nor in a real one. You do the
same, Daphne."</p>

<p>"But my sailor's too large in the head, and
that makes it fall over my eyes, and that gives
it a Frenchy look, like <i>L'Art et la Mode</i>," protested
Daphne.</p>

<p>"Stuff it with paper. Here's the <i>Bystander</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it a pity? There's such a pretty
picture of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn was gracious to-day, and all
was going well when, about half-past five, a
telegram, reply paid, was brought. It was addressed
to Harry.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Why, keep it till he comes. He'll be back to
dinner," Romer said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>"Suppose it's something urgent," said Val,
seeming a little agitated. "Don't you think perhaps
we ought to open it? He won't mind."</p>

<p>"You can't. It's addressed to Harry," said
Romer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyburn's quick eyes took in some signs
of tension, but she continued giving them
advice about the garden. She thought the
flowers too florid, and was always a little shocked
at the extravagant scent and exuberance of the
roses. She seemed to think they should be kept
more in their place&mdash;not allowed to climb all
over the house, and romp or lean about the
garden doing just what they liked. She had
winced in the drawing-room, relented in the
dining-room, and refrained, really, only in the
kitchen, that she had insisted upon seeing. It
was the only room to the decoration of which she
gave whole-hearted praise and approval. The
cooking at the Green Gate she admitted to be
perfect, without pretension. In fact, she thought
everything in the house a little overdone, except
the mutton.</p>

<p>"I can't think who that wire can be from,"
Val said several times to Daphne when her
mother-in-law had gone. She meant that she
could think.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll know directly. Harry's arriving."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>Harry found it in the hall, and came in
with it.</p>

<p>"You open it for me," he said, giving it to
Val.</p>

<p>Since his last instructions to Alec he felt perfectly
safe.</p>

<p>She read&mdash;</p>

<h3>GLADYS</h3>


<p>On arriving in London, Vaughan found his
secretary with the usual heaps of letters.
One envelope, addressed in a large and rather
infantine hand, was put aside for him. The
note ran&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="right">
"The Baldfaced Stag,
Edgware.
</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Vaughan,</p>

<p>"I eard only yesterday that the play you
kindly sent me and mother to was wrote by
you, I call it a shame you didn't tell me before,
we saw the name on the programme, but never
thought it could be the same but yesterday
mother saw a piece in the paper about you in
the weekly dispatch and she said it was the
same, I'm sory I said the people in the play
went on silly I beg pardon for calling the play
silly I wouldnt have done it if Id known, so
hope youre not angry, they seemed to me to go
on silly, but I dont reelly know much about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>those kind of ladies and gentlemen, we saw the
piece in the paper only yesterday and mother
said it was the same, we hope you will soon
come again to tea the calf is better believe me
yours truly</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Gladis Adelaide Brill</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>He instantly wrote back&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dear Miss Brill,
</p>

<p>"I am <i>so</i> relieved and thankful to hear
the calf is better, all the more because I had no
idea it had been indisposed. I fancied, though,
it was looking a little pale the last time I had
the pleasure of meeting it in the field. Please
don't think again of your criticism. It gave me
very great pleasure. You must think me very
foolish. You could say nothing that I would
not like except to ask me not to come and see
you. I am very busy just now and so have little
time for afternoon calls, but will come one of
these days soon.</p>

<p class="right">
"Yours always,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Gilbert Hereford Vaughan</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>He waited a moment, and then added&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will turn up to-morrow at four. Try not
to forget me till then."</p>

<p>For the rest of the day he was in high spirits.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>The letter seemed to keep him up through the
various little bothers of the day. He had been
going to France for the summer. He admitted
to himself that this semi-flirtation was keeping
him in England. He didn't like the idea of
going away very long from the possibility of
turning up at the "Bald-faced Stag."</p>

<p>The explanation Harry gave about Johnson's
telegram satisfied Valentia for the time, as he
declined the invitation to Cowes, but the incident
left an uneasy feeling in Val's mind. She could
not bear to own to herself that he was deceiving
her, and he hadn't the courage to give it away
yet, not that he cared so very much about hurting
her, but he was happier at the Green Gate
than anywhere else. He liked the house, the
atmosphere, and Romer; but what kept him
most was, of course, that curious charm Valentia
had for him, which was perhaps stronger than
ever because he knew that the end was not far
off. He often thought he was a fool not to have
taken the opportunity to break it off on this
occasion. He couldn't stand the idea of not seeing
her, just because of the way her hair grew on her
forehead! So low, and in such thick waves! Alec
Walmer's hair, also fair, was thin and unmeaning.
She had a low forehead, and yet the hair
began high up. In the evening when it was
carefully arranged, and the iron had entered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>into it, it looked like a stiff transformation,
even worse than when left to nature.</p>

<p>But of course, in spite of the reconciliation, a
residue of mistrust remained, and on his side a
sensation of restlessness which left him irritable;
less amiable and pleasant than usual.</p>

<p>They were sitting on the little terrace. He was
smoking and reading the paper. He suddenly
threw it down and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"How quiet you are, Val! Why don't you
talk?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I've got anything to say."</p>

<p>"You seem depressed," he said, rather
aggressively.</p>

<p>"I feel a little depressed."</p>

<p>Harry gave expression to the usual injustice
of the unfaithful.</p>

<p>"What a mistake women make in being
gloomy! How foolish it is. Shall I tell you the
key of the whole situation between men and
women?"</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, it's just&mdash;a <i>smile</i>. Never be dull,
never be ill, never be depressed. Be gay&mdash;always
gay. That's what men like&mdash;that's the one
thing that they go out for and come in for&mdash;a
smile."</p>

<p>"Your ideal of a woman seems to be a Cheshire
cat," she answered, looking rather amused.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>"Your motto is, like the man in <i>The Arcadians</i>:
Always Merry and Bright. Well, I'm sure there's
a good deal in it. But I'm not usually accused of
being a dreary person."</p>

<p>"Of course you're not; you're charming,
lively, amusing, sympathetic. That's your great
attraction, Val. But the last few days you seem
rather to have lost it."</p>

<p>"You can hardly resent my feeling a little
down, Harry. One or two little things that have
happened lately have made me anxious."</p>

<p>"Never be anxious. You ought to trust, trust&mdash;always
trust."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all very well! That wire...."</p>

<p>"Are we going to have that all over again? I
thought I'd explained." He assumed the air of
a patient martyr.</p>

<p>"I know you <i>explained</i> all right. Well, I won't
think about it any more. Don't be horrid, Harry....
Have you seen this week's <i>Punch</i>? There's
something in it simply <i>too</i> heavenly&mdash;such a
joke! Let me read it to you."</p>

<p>"It's very sweet of you&mdash;but do you ever
realise&mdash;&mdash;I wonder if it's ever struck you, Val,
that men aren't always in the mood for heavenly
jokes? There are times when one likes to think&mdash;to
see life as it is&mdash;to discuss abstract things,
even."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>"Oh! Well ... what do you think of Daphne's
dress? Isn't it pretty? It was made by Ogburn, all
out of nothing, in no time."</p>

<p>He looked at Daphne, who was sitting under
a tree reading Cyril's last letter over again.</p>

<p>"It's all right. It suits <i>her</i>. I don't call <i>that</i> a
serious subject."</p>

<p>"What subject would you like, then?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Romer, for instance. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Talking to the gardener about mowing. Do
you want him? I'll call him if you like."</p>

<p>"Dear Val, it's not quite like you to be ironical
to <i>me</i>.... You ought not to laugh at Romer
either. I'm complex, perhaps&mdash;I know I am; but
it jars on me when you do that."</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;I know I'm tiresome," said
Harry, returning to his usual caressing manner.
"Don't take any notice of it. It's&mdash;the weather,
I think, or want of exercise. I'll go and improvise
a little."</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair, and, with a parting
look of forgiveness, he went into the house and
began to improvise (rather dismally) a well-known
funeral march. Or perhaps it was only a
coincidence. Perhaps he would have thought of
it if Chopin hadn't.</p>

<p>Harry was only musical by fits and starts, and
generally either to impress some one or because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>he was out of temper. Val never regarded it as
a good sign when he grappled with the Steinway.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he had grown tired of his
mood of melody, and strolled into the rose garden
with a book.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly Harry was restless.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>THE ANGLES</h3>


<p>"You're very quiet, Val," remarked Daphne,
as they flew along in the motor on their
way to call on the Prebendary's wife at The
Angles.</p>

<p>Both sisters wore little cottage bonnets, blue
motor-veils, and large loose white coats with
high collars.</p>

<p>"How can I talk when we're exceeding the
speed limit?" said Valentia.</p>

<p>"You usually do. Is anything the matter?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing at all.... Harry's been horrid
lately."</p>

<p>"I suppose he <i>is</i> occasionally."</p>

<p>"No, he's not. He's got the artistic temperament,
and of course he can't always be the same,
poor dear."</p>

<p>"What a pity one can't be an artist without
having the artistic temperament! It always
seems to mean being late for meals, and losing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>your temper, or being amusing when every one
wants to go to bed."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," said Valentia, "I never
knew any one with less of it than Harry. There
isn't a more hard-headed business man in the
world in his way, though he <i>has</i> read poetry and
plays the piano sometimes, and paints. He is an
artist too ... but&mdash;well, not in any of the
recognised arts.... I hear Miss Luscombe and
Rathbone&mdash;I mean Mr. and Mrs. Rathbone&mdash;have
gone to Oberammergau for their honeymoon."</p>

<p>"Oh! Is that the latest thing to do?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, Daphne, but she thinks it is.
Miss Luscombe has spent her life in trying to
catch the last omnibus and always just missing it,
and she's not going to leave off now just because
she happens to be married. Here we are!"</p>

<p>The Prebendary's wife received them very
graciously. Her waist looked longer than ever,
and her skirt seemed more than usually abnormal
in width. She did all that she could to
entertain them. She showed them her son
Garstin's map of Buckinghamshire, and then
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll send for Mr. Stoendyck. He's upstairs
inventing. You can't <i>think</i> how clever he is and
how hard he works. It's really wonderful! We
often leave him alone for hours to think things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>out, and sometimes he plays sonatas; he says it refreshes
him. He really is an extraordinary man."</p>

<p>Mr. Stoendyck came in, looking very martial
and scientific and pleased with himself, as though
he had just invented gunpowder. Mrs. Campbell
began as usual to talk baby language, and play a
kind of Dumb Crambo at him. He never seemed
able to guess the word.</p>

<p>"I hope we haven't interrupted you in your
studies," said Val politely.</p>

<p>"She say she ope she not interrupt. Work, you
know. Oeuvre&mdash;Arbeit."</p>

<p>"I was just amusing myself with the very
witty paper from Germany, <i>Kladderadatsch</i>. It
is very funny," he said.</p>

<p>"It sounds funny," said Val sympathetically.</p>

<p>"What I find in England is that you're all
wonderfully serious, wonderfully courteous,
wonderfully kind"&mdash;he bowed to his hostess;
"but, you'll excuse my saying so, I don't find
enough wit or lightness for my temperament.
For humour I have to go to Belgium or
Germany."</p>

<p>He spoke with intense solemnity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell now began to translate him
even to himself.</p>

<p>"You say you like fun, wit&mdash;just fun to make
laugh?" She made strange signs with her
fingers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>He did not appear to understand the code.
He stared at her with a frown, and rasped on
seriously&mdash;</p>

<p>"I find a few comical jokes occasionally a
great relief after my heavy work. It is very deep
work."</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be indiscreet to ask what
the invention is?" said Valentia, smiling.</p>

<p>"Not at all. There is nothing indiscreet whatever
in your curiosity, Mrs. Wyburn."</p>

<p>He took a scone covered with butter and
swallowed it in an extraordinarily short time,
and in an ingenious manner.</p>

<p>"No, there's no indiscretion in the matter at
all. Do not trouble yourself on that score. It is
merely the natural interest that a cultivated
and intellectual English lady would naturally
take when she hears of an extraordinary invention
from another country." He bowed, and
having thus explained her to herself, he then
ate another scone.</p>

<p>"She say she want to know, you know,"
nodded Mrs. Campbell, putting up a playful
and threatening finger with dignified coquetry
and a stony smile. (She was subject to fits of
this kind of marble archness unexpectedly.)</p>

<p>"Yes. So I understood."</p>

<p>The Belgian was looking at Daphne with
distinct admiration. Of course Miss Campbell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>came and sat down beside him. Women always
follow their instinct to come and sit on the other
side of any man whom they regard as their
property. They seem to think that merely by
sitting on the other side they protect him from
freebooters. As a matter of fact, it would be
more sensible, if to distract his attention were
the object, to sit opposite with some one else.</p>

<p>Mr. Stoendyck turned his back on her completely,
and said to Daphne&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very charming, those motor-veils, and the
whole costume. At the same time, while being
thoroughly practical and sensible, it is, if I may
say so, extremely becoming."</p>

<p>He bowed with a condescending air, and went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>"The English young girl&mdash;at least, such
specimens as I have seen in the neighbourhood,
especially in the country&mdash;seems to me a wonderfully
beautiful object. In Belgium we are
getting on, but we have not reached, as yet,
the point of freedom combined with modesty
that you constantly see over here. Particularly,
as I say, in rural districts."</p>

<p>He then made what can only be described,
vulgarly, as a distinct 'eye.'</p>

<p>Both the Campbells looked uneasy.</p>

<p>"The Prebendary will be in soon," said Mrs.
Campbell. "He promised faithfully to come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>back to tea to-day. He also is a very busy man.
He come in soon," she spoke reassuringly.</p>

<p>Daphne was suddenly taken with a <i>fou rire</i>
and began to laugh helplessly. Val, seeing her
condition, and knowing that when she once
started there was no hope but in immediate
flight, took leave.</p>

<p>They were cordially asked to come again by
Mrs. Campbell. But Mr. Stoendyck invited them
to lunch, and wanted to fix a day and hour. Mrs.
Campbell, however, declined his invitation for
them. Mrs. Wyburn, she said, must have a
great many engagements.</p>

<p>They left Stoendyck standing in the hall,
looking sentimental.</p>

<p>"All foreigners not of the Latin race go on
like that," said Val, as they drove back. "They
may be scientific, or soldiers, philosophers, or
musicians, but if they're Germans or Belgians
or Austrians, or anything of that sort, they
always get bowled over by a young girl, a blue
ribbon, plumpness, or fair hair."</p>

<p>"But I'm very thin and dark," said Daphne
angrily.</p>

<p>"I don't care if you are. You're a pretty girl,
you're unmarried, you've got blue chiffon round
your head&mdash;and there it is.... I don't mean
Prussian officers, of course."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>"<i>They</i> would appreciate <i>you</i>, I suppose you
mean!"</p>

<p>"One can't say. They'd probably take on anything."</p>

<p>Valentia took out the little looking-glass from
her motor-bag, looked at it, put it back, and
added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Anything possible, I mean."</p>

<p>"Go on, Val."</p>

<p>"Go on how?"</p>

<p>"Telling me things. You're so interesting,
you know such a lot. Now, about the Latin
races&mdash;wouldn't they like&mdash;er&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"Of course they would. But they'd like you
better if you were married to Cyril or any one.
Frenchmen and Italians always want their love-making
or flirtations to have something in it
of the nature of a <i>score</i>. They love scoring off a
third person, whoever it may be,&mdash;whether it's
their friend's wife, or their wife's friend, or
anything."</p>

<p>"They're not sincere, then?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. If they weren't sincere, why
are there nothing but unwritten-law crimes all
over France and Italy? And why do Parisians
think and talk of ... nothing else! They're
<i>sincere</i> all right: it's their hobby. Italians, of
course, are more jealous and faithful, and
Parisians are frightfully vain&mdash;there's a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>deal of a sort of snobbism about it. They love to
show off. That's why they're so keen on dress."</p>

<p>"Do you think," said Daphne, with sudden
anxiety, "that if you don't dress to perfection
you can't keep a man's love? I <i>do</i> hope not! I
mean because when I'm married to Cyril I
shan't be able to afford to wear anything at all,
except a clean blouse which I shall have to
iron out myself, like in <i>Hearth and Home</i>."</p>

<p>Valentia shook her head.</p>

<p>"Dressing to perfection doesn't make men
love you, silly. It only makes women hate you.
And I never have yet seen the advantage of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, do Parisians want other women to
hate you?" asked Daphne. Her sister hesitated.</p>

<p>"Sometimes. Very often they don't. They
want you to be admired by other people, whoever
they are, men or women. But in Paris dress
counts in a different sort of way&mdash;it means more&mdash;it
stands for more. Oh, don't bother!"</p>

<p>"Well, give me a straightforward Englishman!"
exclaimed Daphne.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" replied Val. "That Belgian
Herr, anyhow, doesn't count. I can't think why
Mrs. Preb. and Miss Campbell are so much in
love with him."</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny? Why do you think it is, Val?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's because he's a man. You see,
they're accustomed to curates."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>AT EDGWARE</h3>


<p>Miss Brill had twisted up her hair and
put on her Sunday dress to receive
Vaughan.</p>

<p>To harmonise with the <a class="ins" href="#tnote_9"  name="tAnchor_9" title="Dicken's">Dickens's</a> garden it
ought to have been white muslin with flounces
and a pink sash. But it was a quite long, dark
blue Liberty satin, made by a smart dressmaker
in the Finchley Road. It had a high collar, an
Empire waist, and gathers.</p>

<p>Her mother was delighted with it. Gladys
had not been quite satisfied herself, and had
tried to tie it in round the ankles with concealed
string, to make it look more like a nobble skirt,
as she called it.</p>

<p>Her almost too abundant hair had been piled
over a pad, which gave her the appearance of
having a swollen head. Yet even so she looked
lovely, rather like an old-fashioned picture in
the Academy of <i>I'se Gan'ma</i>, or something of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>the kind, suggesting a baby disguised as a
grown-up-person.</p>

<p>Vaughan went through the usual ritual of
asking after Mrs. Brill&mdash;he rather hurried Mr.
Brill over his remark about the finest woman
one would see in a day's march&mdash;then admired
the weather, ordered tea, and asked for Miss Brill.</p>

<p>Gladys came and sat down with a rather shy,
self-conscious air.</p>

<p>She soon lost it, however, and began to get
natural again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Vaughan! I <i>never</i> was more surprised
than I was at that piece in the paper! And
mother come over quite queer, she was so
surprised. You were kind in your letter to forgive
me for being rude. Who'd ever have
thought you was clever?"</p>

<p>"Who, indeed! But, Gladys, why this get-up?
Why are you dressed up in satin and dark colours
on a summer day?"</p>

<p>"Why, mother said a nice navy blue was
always useful. I'd rather have had a Cambridge
blue myself. Mother says navy blue's so ladylike.
Don't you like it?"</p>

<p>"Charming. But I don't like what you've done
to your hair."</p>

<p>"Don't you, though? Fancy! Well, I don't
seem to care much for it myself. It's a Pompadour,
you know&mdash;a pad."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>"Take it off," said Vaughan.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't!"</p>

<p>"All right, <i>I</i> will. Come in the field."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind if you do. I'll say I took
my hair down because it was heavy."</p>

<p>"You've tried to spoil yourself, but you
haven't succeeded. Why did you do it, Gladys?"</p>

<p>"Seeing you was clever, I thought pr'aps I'd
better try to look more grown-up."</p>

<p>"Ah! what a mistake! Your great charm is
that you're such a regular J.F."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"A <i>jeune fille</i>."</p>

<p>"What does that mean? What's a J.F. in
English?"</p>

<p>"A jolly flapper."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the field Vaughan, with several interruptions
and reproaches for being a caution,
managed to take the pad off her head and to
throw it in the field. But an unfortunate thing
happened. All the corn-coloured hair fell down
over his face and he had kissed her&mdash;by accident&mdash;before
he knew it.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! You are a caution!" was her only
remark. But she did not laugh, and as she hastily
did a little amateur coiffing, he thought she
looked slightly annoyed. At any rate, she hadn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>much more to say to him, and he went back to
London almost immediately, feeling quite absurdly
agitated about such an unimportant trifle.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>An hour later, when quietly at home in his
study, Vaughan was suddenly seized by that
species of madness that has been known to wreck
careers, "to launch a thousand ships," to cause
all kinds of chaos. It was that terrible
<i>once-on-board-the-lugger-and-the-girl-is-mine-I-must-and-shall-possess-her</i>
feeling in its most acute
form. Most men have known it at some time in
their lives. He thought of Harry de Freyne, and
felt noble and superior in contrast to what <i>his</i>
conduct would have been, as he sat down and
wrote with intense pleasure&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Darling Gladys,
</p>

<p>"I love you. Will you marry me? Please
try. I'm writing to your father. Don't keep me
waiting long for the answer.</p>

<p class="sgntr noind">
 "Yours for always,<br />
<span class="smcap">"Gillie</span>."
</p></div>

<p>He then wrote a long and sensible letter to
Mr. Brill; all business, respect, and urgency,
saying he knew that Gladys was very young, but
that he would make her happy, and so forth.</p>

<p>These two letters he sent off by express messenger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>in a taxicab to the "Bald-faced Stag,"
and then sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>What a dinner! And what an evening he
spent! He planned a long journey&mdash;what fun to
show the child new places and things! Why
shouldn't he marry the charming, refined, and
beautiful daughter of an hotel-keeper? He
decided even on alterations in the house, and
he meant to be ecstatically happy.</p>

<p>What did he care for people? He had never
lived either to <i>&eacute;pater</i> the <i>bourgeois</i> or to satisfy
the ideal of the gentleman next door. He was
going to do something <i>he</i> liked!...</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He woke up the next morning at six o'clock
with a ghastly chilly horror on him. What had
he done? Had he been mad? To marry Miss Brill,
the daughter of the landlord of a little suburban
public-house! A girl of sixteen, pretty enough
certainly, but with no pretensions to being a
lady, no possibility of having anything in common
with him. But it wasn't so much the
question of what people would say&mdash;of course,
most of the women he knew would drop him,
and the men would laugh at him and make love
to her&mdash;but, how long would it last? How long
would this strange mania endure? Perhaps not
a week. The poor child would have an awful
time, too. She was much happier as she was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Well! He was a sportsman, and had taken
the risk. He must wait now. At the back of his
mind he was wondering how he could get out
of it.</p>

<p>He had not to wait long. His letters were
answered by the first post. Evidently, the "Bald-faced
Stag" had been kept up late that night to
reply in time.</p>

<p>Gladys wrote very respectfully that she was
very sorry she hadn't told him before, but she
was privately engaged to the son of the landlord
of the Green Man at Stanmore: the Eldest
Son, she wrote with pride (as though he would
inherit the title). She was awfully sorry. Besides,
she was going to be a manicure, first, for two
years, and then settle down at Stanmore. Her
fianc&eacute; was twenty-one. She hoped Mr. Vaughan
would come over to tea very soon, and she
thought his letter was very kind, and remained
his truly, Gladys Brill.</p>

<p>Mr. Brill had written a long and slightly
rambling letter which suggested rough copies
and even some assistance from the old vintages
of the "Bald-faced Stag." He refused most firmly,
though thoroughly sensible of the honour done
him by Mr. Vaughan's offer, but he couldn't go
back on his word to his friend at the Green
Man. The arrangement had been made, when
Gladys and the son were in their cradles, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>him and his pal of the Green Man and he
couldn't go back on his word. And Gladys liked
the young chap; and it was a great honour,
indeed, that Mr. Vaughan had done them, and
it would have been splendid for Gladys in the
worldly sense. But there! it was better, perhaps,
not to mix up Stations. Mr. Brill repeated this
sentiment over and over again, always using
a capital S for station&mdash;(as though Vaughan had
expressed an insane desire to confuse Victoria
with the Great Western). And he remained very
respectfully, Tom Brill.</p>

<p>"A manicure in Bond Street and then the
landlady of a common country inn! Never! She
shan't! I'll go down and persuade her. I'll make
them come round."</p>

<p>Vaughan was so hurt and disappointed that
he felt he could never smile again.</p>

<p>But he did.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>TENSION</h3>


<p>When the sisters came back from their
drive Harry was sitting on the little
marble terrace reading <i>Count Florio and Phillis
K.</i> and smoking cigarettes. With almost conjugal
unfairness he complained that Valentia
always went out just before he arrived. In fact,
he had begged her to get the visit over that
afternoon, as he intended to be late.</p>

<p>Valentia sat down and began a lively account
of "The Angles," but he implored her not to
describe those awful people at home, and particularly
not to tell him anything about that
poisonous Belgian. Then he told Val that blue
didn't suit her, and, when she agreed with him,
petulantly complained that she had no ideas of
her own.</p>

<p>"But I had an idea of my own; only now you
say it's wrong."</p>

<p>"So it is. But, even if it is wrong, you should
stick to it. You should have more individuality."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>"What an awful word," she said.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the word?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It's so long."</p>

<p>"You're talking nonsense, Valentia."</p>

<p>"Well, why shouldn't I talk nonsense? I'm
sure I've heard you say there's nothing so depressing
as a woman with no nonsense about
her."</p>

<p>"I know. But there needn't be nothing else."</p>

<p>"Harry, are you trying to quarrel? If so I'd
better go away."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right! Very well! Do as you like,"
said Harry. "It seems a curious way to treat a
guest: to go out when you expect him, and then
the moment you come in to make an excuse to
leave him alone again. But please yourself!"</p>

<p>He took up his book and turned away.</p>

<p>Valentia went into the house, to her room,
and sat down opposite the looking-glass with a
sigh. It was at moments like these that she
sometimes thought, with a slight reaction, of
Romer. Romer was never capricious, never
irritable, never trying. It was true that he rarely
answered her except in monosyllables, but yet
she knew that he delighted in and tacitly encouraged
her fluency. He did not respond to
every idea she expressed as Harry did (when
Harry was in a good temper), but she knew she
had no better audience. His extreme quietness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>might be admitted, occasionally, to cast a slight
gloom, but negatively what enormous advantages
his silence had! Romer never scolded,
never laid down the law; never thought it
necessary to give her long, minute, detailed
accounts of his impressions of art, or life, or
literature; never insisted on pointing out, as if
it were a matter of life and death, precisely
where he differed in his opinions of a book, a
play, or an incident, from the criticisms in the
daily papers. Nor did he refer to some annoying
past incident half a dozen times a day as a
sealed subject. He had other qualities. He could
take tickets, he could sign cheques (and even
seemed to like doing it). He could see about
things. He wasn't selfish. Yes, Valentia thought,
when she saw Harry at his worst, that perhaps
she didn't really quite appreciate her husband.
How irritating Harry would have been in that
capacity!</p>

<p>Daphne came in, and Valentia went on, as
usual, with her thoughts aloud.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't Harry be a maddening husband?"
she said as she brushed out her hair.</p>

<p>"Oh! Would he? In what way?"</p>

<p>"He'd be so selfish, so obtrusive&mdash;he'd always
want you to do exactly what he liked, just when
he liked, and never when he didn't, or when
you liked, I mean."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>"How could he like you to do what he liked
when he didn't like? That would be expecting
too much. I don't see what you mean, Val."</p>

<p>"I only mean that when he's in a bad temper
Harry's tiresome, and if he were married he'd
be in one oftener."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Are most men bad-tempered when
they're married, Val?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Nearly always."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i> Then, will Cyril ..."</p>

<p>"Cyril's a pleasant, easy-going boy, but, as
you won't have enough money, he's sure to be
bad-tempered at times."</p>

<p>"Then aren't married men bad-tempered
when they have plenty of money, Val?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if they have a great deal they're awfully
bad-tempered, too; because, you see, then they
lose it, or if they don't do that they're always
trying to enjoy themselves with it and finding
the enjoyment flat, and then they blame their
wives. Besides, anyhow, having enough money
leads to all sorts of complications."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Then what do you advise?"
Daphne hung on Valentia's words, respecting
her superior knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>"Oh, I advise enough, anyhow. It can't make
you happy, but it can avoid certain troubles.
Love in a cottage is only all right for the week-end
when you have a nice house in London as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>well, and a season ticket or a motor, and electric
light and things, and a telephone. Oh, by the
way, our telephone here is eating its head off.
We never use it. Go and ring up to the grocer,
not to forget to send the things, will you, dear?
He's got a telephone, too&mdash;the only tradesman
in the village who has."</p>

<p>"What things isn't he to forget to send?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?&mdash;the usual things. He
never does forget, but it looks well to remind
him, and the 'phone needs exercise."</p>

<p>"All right. But before I go, Val&mdash;suppose you
can't have the sort of love-in-a-cottage you
mean, and there's no fear of your being so rich
that it makes you miserable, what is the best
thing to do?"</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose the old business in the old
novels, a competence with the man of your heart,
would do all right."</p>

<p>Daphne looked pleased.</p>

<p>"For six months, anyhow. Or a year or two,
perhaps," Val added.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" cried Daphne again, as she left
the room.</p>

<p>"Poor pet," Val murmured to herself. "I hope
I'm not teaching her to be cynical."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>GOOD-BYE</h3>


<p>The only person in the family who did not
thoroughly approve of Gladys's decision
was her mother. Mrs. Brill thought it sheer
madness to decline proposals of a 'gentleman
from the West End,' as she called him; so clever
and so rich, so handsome and so much in love.
She was romantic and yet worldly in her views,
and was much excited at the idea of the rivalry
for her daughter. There were bitter scenes
between Mr. and Mrs. Brill on the subject. Mr.
Brill was not romantic nor worldly, but he was
very sentimental, and he didn't hold with breaking
his word to the Green Man, nor indeed with
that mixing up of Stations to which he had
already alluded.</p>

<p>Between the opposing views of her parents
Gladys became somewhat bewildered. She liked
the son of the Green Man (he was in reality
only a green boy, but good-looking, and she
had always known him), and she wished to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>loyal to him. Yet her mother's remarks about
Mr. Vaughan began to appeal to her imagination,
such as it was. She was rather dazzled and
began to weaken. She was at the age when one
can really be in love with anybody, and she was
flattered. Though she felt she would feel more
at home with her childhood's friend, she began,
very slightly, to look down upon him when she
compared him with Gillie.</p>

<p>Vaughan came down the day after he had received
her letter, and behaved precisely as usual.</p>

<p>Mr. Brill, meeting him with a rather shamefaced
air in the garden, said straightforwardly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very pleased indeed to see you, Mr.
Vaughan. You got my letter, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. To my sorrow. I want to talk
to you about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I was sorry to write it, sir, if you take
my meaning. But there! Well, Mrs. Brill 'as expressed
a wish for a few words with you, if you
wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted, of course. But&mdash;may I
see Gladys?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir. Tea and bread and butter?
The usual thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please. As usual." Mr. Brill lingered.</p>

<p>"Ave some watercress with it, sir," he added
sympathetically, "or we've got some very nice
little radishes. Ow about them?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>Vaughan nearly laughed.</p>

<p>"No, thank you! I'm afraid they wouldn't be
any use to me, Mr. Brill."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! You will have your joke!"</p>

<p>Mr. Brill went in and told his wife that Mr.
Vaughan was "sitting there looking that miserable
it was enough to make one's heart ache."</p>

<p>With this satisfactory intelligence he sent
Gladys into the garden.</p>

<p>She was all blushes and shyness. Her hair had
gone back into the long plait, and she wore her
schoolgirl dress again.</p>

<p>"You're too proud, Gladys!" he said reproachfully.
"Why did you never tell me of your
engagement?"</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't ardly count it to interest you,
Mr. Vaughan. Besides, it's not to be for two
years."</p>

<p>"Are you in love with him?"</p>

<p>"Why, what a question! I <i>like</i> him. He's a
nice boy."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's very much in love with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right."</p>

<p>"That was a very cruel letter you wrote me,
Gladys."</p>

<p>"I was afraid you'd think it rude," she answered
apologetically.</p>

<p>"No, dear. It isn't rude to refuse a proposal.
You can't accept them all, can you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>"You've made a wretched tea, Mr. Vaughan.
Is there anything else you'd like?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to go in the field again, like the
day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"Was it only the day before yesterday? So it
was. A lot seems to ave appened since. Well,
come along."</p>

<p>She looked such an absolute child as she
climbed the gate that Gillie felt almost ashamed
of his proposal, and thought that probably her
father was quite right.... But her face was so
exactly like Sir Joshua Reynolds' angels' heads,
she might have sat for them. She was too absurdly
pretty. And sweet, too, he thought. She had
no vulgar pretensions, she was simple. She only
wanted a little polish. He could teach her everything
necessary. No task could have been more
congenial....</p>

<p>"So you think I'm too old for you. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. It isn't that. It's what father
told you."</p>

<p>"Would you hate to go for a long journey
with me, to see other places, other countries?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; I'd like it. We went to Clacton last
summer. It <i>was</i> fun."</p>

<p>He thought a little.</p>

<p>"Gladys, as you're so young, won't you leave
the whole thing in abeyance for a time?"</p>

<p>"In what, did you say?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>"Undecided. Let me come and talk to you
about it in six months. The only thing I can't
bear you to do is to be a manicure. I'm going
to speak to your mother about it. I can't stand it."</p>

<p>"Oh, why, Mr. Vaughan? I should have
thought it was nice for me to sort of better
myself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Far better stay here. Well, will
you agree to that?"</p>

<p>"To give up the manicuring and to leave the
engagement open like? Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea."</p>

<p>She thought a minute.</p>

<p>"I really don't see how I can. And&mdash;my boy
would feel it something cruel if I put him off
like that."</p>

<p>"When do you see him?" he asked jealously.</p>

<p>"Why, on Sundays. Only on Sundays."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's why I've never seen him. I
wondered why I'd never met my hated rival."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, you're going on silly, like the
people in the play!... I don't believe you alf
mean it."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe I love you?"</p>

<p>"How can you? You don't ardly know me,
except as a friend."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why I love you if you like,
dearest."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>"Well, why?" She spoke with girlish curiosity.</p>

<p>"Because you're lovely, and lovable, and
sweet. Because you're a darling."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't your boy, as you call him, say these
things to <a class="ins" href="#tnote_10"  name="tAnchor_10" title="you?'">you?"</a></p>

<p>"Not like that. I only see him on Sundays."</p>

<p>"And does he kiss you on Sundays?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>Vaughan got up.</p>

<p>"All right, I won't worry you any more....
I'll let you be happy in your own way, dear....
I must go now."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>must</i> you?"</p>

<p>She seemed very disappointed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going to France."</p>

<p>"What, to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, next week."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>He went in and bid adieu to Mr. and Mrs.
Brill and the "Bald-faced Stag" for ever. He said
to her father that he was resigned.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As soon as he had gone, Gladys went upstairs
to her room, looked in the glass, then burst out
crying.</p>

<p>She had fallen in love with Gillie.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>ROMER OVERHEARS</h3>


<p>Romer started to go by himself for a five-mile
walk, leaving Daphne, Valentia and
Harry in the garden, but a nail in his boot hurt
so much that, after the first half-mile, Romer
decided he couldn't stand it any longer, and
would walk back, go quietly in, and then surprise
them by coming to tea in the garden.</p>

<p>He was gone a very short time, but he
hastened his steps, looking forward immensely
to the removal of the boot, and also to seeing
Valentia again.</p>

<p>Lately he had been more than ever devoted
to her. Ever since they had been at the Green
Gate she had been specially gentle and charming&mdash;but
not nearly so lively as usual. Sometimes
she looked quite anxious and preoccupied.
He thought, too, that she was
occasionally irritable; which was unlike her&mdash;and
her spirits varied continually.</p>

<p>He asked her one day what was the matter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>and she assured him that there was nothing, so
he believed her. But he was always thinking
about her, trying to find some means to please
her. He was dissatisfied about her.</p>

<p>He came back, went into his room, and his
spirits incalculably raised by the cessation of the
torture, he went and sat by the window, and
looked out at the lovely garden.</p>

<p>It was a hot summer day; a little wind was in
the trees.</p>

<p>Exactly under the window, on the little
verandah, sat Harry with Valentia. Daphne was
no longer there.</p>

<p>They were talking; and talking, it seemed to
him, in an agitated way.</p>

<p>Leaning a little over he could see Valentia on
a bamboo chair. To his horror he saw that she
was crying.</p>

<p>Harry, speaking in a suppressed but rather
angry voice, appeared to be trying to comfort her.</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation or a moment's
scruple, Romer intently listened. He did not hide
or draw behind the curtain. He remained in full
view, in the window, so that they could see him
easily if they happened to look up. But they did
not; they were far too much preoccupied.... He
heard Harry speaking volubly, saying, in a tone
of irritated apology and explanation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>"My dear girl, I do wish to heaven you
wouldn't take it like that. I haven't changed&mdash;I
never shall. I don't care two straws about Miss
Walmer. But really, it is such a splendid chance
for me! You ought no more to expect me to give
it up than any other good business opportunity
that might crop up."</p>

<p>"I should never see you again," she answered,
her voice broken by sobs.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would. We should be the same as
ever. You know we can't do without each other.
You're part of my life."</p>

<p>He spoke casually, but with irritation, as if
mentioning a self-evident fact.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you say that," she answered sadly.
"But nothing could alter the fact that you wish
to be treacherous, and throw me over&mdash;and just
for money! It's simply degrading. It's all nonsense
to say it will be just the same!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course&mdash;for a time&mdash;immediately
after the marriage&mdash;it couldn't be; but it would
gradually drift into very much the same."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't, even if it could, because I
should never see you again," she repeated.</p>

<p>Harry stood up with his hands in his pockets,
his shoulders raised.</p>

<p>Romer could see his face quite plainly, and
wondered at its hard, selfish, almost cruel expression.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>"Well, if you won't you won't," he said.
"How can I waste all my life dangling after a
woman who is married to somebody else? I
should be only too delighted&mdash;if I could afford
it. But I can't, and that's the brutal truth. And
then, you know, there has been a little talk.
That mother-in-law of yours has been gossiping
about us. Some day, Romer's bound to get
hold of it, and then where shall we be? Don't
you see, dear," he went on more gently, "this
will stop all that? Wouldn't it be better for me
to be married&mdash;just in this official sort of way&mdash;to
remain in England, and be able to see you
just the same as ever&mdash;very soon&mdash;than to go
out to the colonies or somewhere, and never
see you again at all? There's no doubt I've got
to do something. I'm in a frightful hole. Seven
thousand a year&mdash;a place in the country&mdash;and a
decent sort of girl, dropped down on me, as it
were, from heaven! I hadn't the slightest idea
of such luck&mdash;and hadn't any pretensions to it.
But the girl has taken a liking to me, and her
mother wants to get her married. It's ugly&mdash;unromantic&mdash;but
there are the facts. If you
cared for me really, I shouldn't think you would
want to stand in my way."</p>

<p>"Very well, do it, then," she said, drying her
eyes. "If you can speak in this heartless way it
shows you are very different from what I believed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>you. But it will kill me; I shall never get
over it."</p>

<p>She was rushing away when Harry caught her
hand and stopped her.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, in an impressive voice. "Go
to your room, bathe your eyes, and calm yourself
down. Make no more scenes, for heaven's
sake, and we'll see what can be done."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, really&mdash;<i>is</i> there any hope? Or
are you deceiving me again?"</p>

<p>"I've almost agreed to it, you know," he said.
"Still, there's not what one could call an actual
engagement yet. At any rate, it might be delayed.
I'll see; I'll think&mdash;really if I weren't so
hard up I wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!" A gleam of joy came into her
eyes, and she clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Then you won't worry me any more about
it for the next few days?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I promise;" and smiling sweetly through her
tears she left him, going into the house. Her
room, on the same floor as Romer's, was at the
other end of the corridor, so she did not even
pass his door, and had not the slightest idea
that he was at home.</p>

<p>He was still at the window, looking out apparently
at the garden.</p>

<p>Harry gave an impatient sigh, lit a cigarette
and strolled off through the garden.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>It had been about three o'clock when Romer
had come in and sat down by the window. He
was still there in precisely the same position at
seven, when his valet brought his hot water.</p>

<p>But Romer could not dress and go down to
dinner. He could not see them till he had made
up his mind what to do. He always thought
slowly, and now he was acutely anxious to make
no mistake. He felt that by the slightest wrong
move he might lose Valentia altogether. That,
at least, was his instinctive dread. He sent Valentia
a message that he had to go up to London
to see his mother, and would be back the next
day. He arranged that she did not get the message
till he was driving to the station&mdash;just
before dinner.</p>

<p>He went up to London and stayed at an
hotel, but did not go to his mother's, and
thought nearly all night till he had made a
resolution. Then he slept till nine o'clock, feeling
much happier. He remembered clearly that
Harry was coming to town and going to the
studio on this day, as he often did. He calculated
that he would be likely to arrive by the
quick early morning train, and was standing
waiting at the door of the studio at twelve
o'clock when Harry drove up, looking intensely
surprised, with hand outstretched, cordial and
delighted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>"My dear fellow, how jolly of you to remember
I was coming up! Come in, come in! I've
only got this bothering business to attend to,
then we'll lunch together, and go back by the
four train, shall we? You won't have to stop on
here, will you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Romer, as he followed
Harry.</p>

<p>"Your mother's not ill, I hope," said Harry,
throwing himself into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Romer; "she's at
Bournemouth."</p>

<p>"Bournemouth! How like her! But you
haven't been down there to see her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so."</p>

<p>"Then it isn't your mother that brought you
up to town, old chap?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong?" asked Harry, after a
moment's pause.</p>

<p>It struck him that Romer looked very odd,
and as he noted a slightly greyish tinge in
Romer's face, he turned pale himself under his
becoming sunburn.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" repeated Harry, who
could not be quiet. His weakness lay in the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>that he never, under any circumstances, could
entirely "hold his tongue."</p>

<p>Romer put down his stick and hat, which he
had been holding, took a chair exactly opposite
Harry, stared him in the face, and said in a dry,
hard voice, much less slowly than usual&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's something I wish you to do."</p>

<p>"You wish me to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Write to Miss Walmer definitely breaking
off your engagement."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;engagement?"</p>

<p>"I heard what you said yesterday afternoon.
I came back from my walk&mdash;there was a nail in
my boot. I heard every word from the window
in my room."</p>

<p>"You listened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I listened."</p>

<p>"Romer, my dear fellow, I swear to you
that ..."</p>

<p>"Don't swear anything to me," said Romer
quietly. "And don't dare to defend Valentia to
me.... I advise you not."</p>

<p>Harry was silent, utterly bewildered.</p>

<p>"I find that your&mdash;&mdash;friendship, instead of
being a pleasure to her, is making her miserable.
For some reason she likes to have you about. She
doesn't wish you to marry Miss Walmer. Well,
you shan't! Do you hear that? You shan't!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>You're not going to marry that girl and then
come dangling about again."</p>

<p>He waited a minute and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Valentia's got to be happy. You're not
going to have everything <i>you</i> want. You can
surely make a little sacrifice to be her friend!"
Then for one moment only Romer nearly lost
his control. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We've been married five years, and I've
never said a word or done a thing that she
didn't like. And <i>you</i> made her cry. You! You
made her cry!"</p>

<p>"My dear Romer, I assure you it's all ..."</p>

<p>Romer interrupted him in a low voice, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, will you? I want no talk or
discussion. I want only one thing. You're to
write immediately, definitely putting an end
to this engagement. While you write the letter
I'll wait, and then I'll post it myself. Will you
do it?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, of course I'll do anything.
But how strange you are! I should have
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to know what you would have
thought, and I don't care a straw what you
think of my attitude. On condition you do what
I say, I shall never refer to the subject again,
and everything shall be as it has been."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>Harry was obviously greatly relieved.</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you wish," he said,
looking and feeling ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>Seeing that Romer was evidently in a hurry
for the letter, he drew writing materials to him.</p>

<p>Then Romer said&mdash;</p>

<p>"One more thing. You are not to tell Valentia
anything about this. She's not to know I
overheard. I won't have her distressed. Remember
that."</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honour," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Very well. And when I've posted the letter
we'll wipe out the whole thing. Don't even say
you saw me in town."</p>

<p>"Of course I won't."</p>

<p>As Harry bent his head low over the writing-table,
Romer, who was sitting motionless,
looked at a curious dagger that was hanging on
the wall, with a horrible sudden longing to
plunge it in Harry's neck.... Horrified at his
own fancy, he looked away from it and thought
of Valentia. Valentia would smile and be happy
now, and everything would go smoothly again.
He would not have to say anything painful to
her; she would never be uncomfortable in his
presence. In time she would probably grow
tired of Harry and could turn to him, Romer,
again, with more affection than if anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>painful had passed between them.... His
attitude had been extraordinarily unselfish,
and yet it had its root in the deep scheming
selfishness and subtle calculation of the passion
of love. To get Valentia back, as he vaguely
hoped, some time, however distant, he had
acted most wisely, and he knew it. For he cared
for her far too much ever to have conventional
thoughts on the subject. It never even occurred
to him to try to act as the husband ought to act,
or as by the incessant insidious influence of
plays and novels most of us have been brought
up to think he ought to act. Most people are far
more guided than they know in their views of
life by the artificial conventions of the theatre
and of literature, or by tradition. In fact, most
people are other people. Romer was himself. He
thought simply for himself, like a child. And so
it happened that he acted in a crisis terrible to
him, more wisely for his own interest than the
most sophisticated of men....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Here is the letter. Will you read it?"</p>

<p>Romer read it and put it back in the envelope.
Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"All right. You're going back to the Green
Gate this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"If I may."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>"I shall be back to-morrow," said Romer, in
his ordinary voice.</p>

<p>Harry accompanied him to the door and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>Romer hesitated a moment. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-bye," with a nod, and went away,
taking no notice of it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"By Jove!" said Harry, to himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>THE LIMIT</h3>


<p>Romer went back to his hotel that evening
feeling happier than he had ever expected
to be again. He felt sure now that everything
would be perfectly right. He refused to allow
himself to dwell for a moment on possibilities,
and on what had been, or on what might have
been. But he was like a man who had been
slightly stunned by a blow on the head and was
beginning to feel the pain the next day. Yet the
pain was not very acute; he did not quite realise
it, but, unconsciously, it made him feverish.
And he was still a little stupefied. It did not
occur to him to go to the Club, or to look up any
friends, and he remained in the little hotel in
Jermyn Street, filled at this time of the year
principally by Americans, and he dined alone
there&mdash;dined well, and smoked a long cigar.
Then he went for a walk. London at the beginning
of August was not empty, but stale,
crowded, untidy, hot&mdash;unlike itself. He tried
not to think of the garden of the Green Gate.
Suddenly, with a stab, he imagined Harry and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>Valentia; probably now he was telling her that
the engagement was broken off, and she was
smiling and happy. Well! it was what he wished.
Since what had happened he felt his great love
for Valentia was much less vivid than it had
been. He cared for her more remotely. She
seemed at a great distance. He thought that he
felt more to her as if she were a dear sister and
living far away. Yes, that was it; he loved her
now like a sister.</p>

<p>Surprised at his own calm, and much pleased
with his behaviour in the matter, he retired to
bed. The instant he had closed his eyes he
seemed to see, with the clearness of an hallucination,
Harry's head bending low over the
writing-table, and, hanging above him on the
wall of the studio, the curious dagger; a
Japanese weapon that was one of Harry's
treasures. And Romer felt again precisely the
same horrible longing that he had felt that
morning at the studio&mdash;the sudden longing to
plunge it into Harry's neck. Horrified at the
fancy and at himself, he turned up the light
and tried to read. He could not fix his attention
on a word of the article "Silk and Stuff" in the
<i>Pall Mall</i>....</p>

<p>Of course he was not angry with Valentia;
how could she help it? She must be made happy.
But she seemed dim, distant, remote. It was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>effort to recall her face.... Harry&mdash;Harry did
not seem very real to him either. It was all
unreal. But he, Romer, had done the right thing.
Harry would never make her cry again.</p>

<p>Everything would go on as before. And <i>he</i>
had never said a word that it would be painful
for them both to remember. There was nothing
uncomfortable between them. He felt she
would grow tired of Harry of her own accord,
and would then return to him, Romer, with no
disagreeable recollection of scenes, nor of their
having said horrible things to one another.
Yes, he had been quite right. Yet she did not
seem to him so near as she used to be. He was
not angry with her.... No, of course not. He
was not jealous. Perhaps she seemed more remote,
more distant, because he felt a certain
coldness, and&mdash;yes&mdash;the coldness was there
because he was a little hurt perhaps.... And
then he tried to go to sleep again. But instantly
his insane vision came back, and he got up and
walked round the room and tried to banish
it.... At last he really went to sleep, and awoke
trembling with horror. He had had a horrible
dream. He dreamt that Harry was writing a
letter, and that he had taken the dagger from
the wall of the studio and killed him. This was
simply horrible.</p>

<p>Then he began to realise the reason. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>subconscious jealousy. Then he saw that he had
set himself a task too big for him, and that he
could not endure to see Harry with Valentia
now. It would be impossible to bear it. He
would have to tell him to go. He had mistaken
his own feelings. What he had heard on the
verandah, what he had imagined, could never
be obliterated. Indeed, he saw clearly that if he
tried to endure it he would break down. The
effort would lead to madness.&mdash;It was impossible....
He had sent Harry back to her! He
had actually sent him; it was unbearable.</p>

<p>He would go back the next day, take Harry
aside, and tell him that he had found he
couldn't bear it, and that on some pretext he
must go away. He would tell him that he had
reached the limit of his endurance and could
bear no more. He would never speak of it to
Valentia. Valentia would be sad&mdash;but that
could not be helped. He knew, now, that he
could not endure the sight of Harry again.</p>

<p>Having made this resolution, he became
much calmer. But the dream recurred each time
he went to sleep until, in dread of it, he resolved
to sleep no more. His nerves felt shattered.</p>

<p>And then, he began to count the minutes till
he could be back at the Green Gate. To see
Valentia again and to banish Harry for ever!
And all the obvious, human feelings that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>thought he was free from had come back. He
broke down; bitter tears of self-pity, of sentiment,
and of heartbroken humiliation fell from
his eyes. He remembered their engagement and
their honeymoon, and then the eternal and
everlasting amusing cousin; Harry, and his
sickening good looks and ceaseless chatter. No
more of it, by heaven! It would be something
worth having lived for to have no more of the
brilliant Harry. He saw now that he had always
been subconsciously jealous of him&mdash;that
he had always loathed and hated him. And
rightly, by instinct; for not only had he done
the most unpardonable injury one friend can
do to another, without a scruple and without a
hesitation, but he had shown the same baseness
to her. He made her unhappy. He made her
cry. He wanted to marry for money and come
back again, treacherous to every one&mdash;hard,
heartless, selfish, vulgar in mind and in attitude
to life. Romer hated him.</p>

<p>Well! Romer would tell him that very day
that he had changed his mind and that he was
to go anywhere&mdash;anyhow&mdash;only to go. Neither
he nor Valentia should ever see him again.</p>

<p>Valentia seemed a long way off. She seemed
remote and distant. That was because he was
still hurt and angry. When Harry had once
gone, perhaps she would seem near again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>RECONCILIATION</h3>


<p>Romer had made one mistake in his calculations.
He had forgotten that Harry
was a talker. He fully believed that the young
man would go back and get all possible credit
from Valentia for breaking off the engagement,
and would adhere to the very letter of their
strange agreement. This, indeed, Harry fully
intended to do. When he first went back he
told her, to her immense joy and satisfaction,
merely that he had broken it off. But when
some people who had come to dinner had gone
away and she and Harry could be alone, the
habit of confidential gossip, the habit, especially,
of impressing and surprising her, and, above all,
the inability to keep to himself anything so
amazing, was too strong for him.</p>

<p>Picturesquely, vividly, and quite amusingly
Harry told her every word of the story; first
exacting a solemn promise not to repeat it.</p>

<p>"Isn't he <i>impayable</i>? Isn't he a marvel?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>No, Valentia, don't look so grave, or I shall
think you've lost your sense of humour."</p>

<p>"But do you believe he really thinks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He doesn't think," said Harry, stopping her.
"He won't think. You're faultless in his eyes. He
would never allow himself to imagine you anything
else. Valentia, this is a wonderful situation&mdash;you
don't appreciate it! It's unheard of! He
particularly wished that everything should go
on as before."</p>

<p>He took her hand. She immediately took it
away and drew back coldly.</p>

<p>"A wonderful situation! Do you think Van
Buren will enjoy it?" she asked satirically.</p>

<p>"Van Buren! What on earth do you mean,
Val? Do you suppose for a minute that I'd talk
about it?"</p>

<p>"I know you will. You couldn't resist it. It's
<i>impayable</i> you say.... Oh, but it was mean of
you to tell me!"</p>

<p>"Mean!" cried Harry indignantly. "Why, it
was very generous! I might easily have pleased
you very much more by saying I broke it off
quite of my own accord."</p>

<p>"That wasn't why you told me. You wanted
me to laugh at Romer and think him ridiculous."</p>

<p>"I don't at all. I was in the ridiculous position.
Be a woman of the world, Val. Don't talk bosh!
We shall soon forget it happened."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>"I shall never forget," she answered. "And
things <i>can't</i> go on as they were, because I think
he's behaved magnificently, because I think he's
heroic. And if I didn't appreciate the way he
spared me I should be.... Why, don't you realise
what it must have been for him, Harry, to hear
every word we said? And yet he didn't try to
make me suffer for it!"</p>

<p>"He complained that <i>I</i> made you cry!" said
Harry with a ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>"Look here, Harry, it's no good. I see I was
right about Romer from the first. I married him
because I thought there was something remarkable&mdash;something
finer than other people about
him. And I was right."</p>

<p>"If you talk like that, I shall know you're in
love with him," said Harry tauntingly and
angrily. "<i>I</i> was a fool to tell you. You're just
upset, my dear," he added, "at the idea of his
knowing of the whole thing. By to-morrow,
when he comes back, everything will have
calmed down."</p>

<p>"I want to be left alone," said Valentia.</p>

<p>Harry was annoyed, for he himself was not
just now in the mood for reverie, and even in the
smallest things he disliked giving up his own
wishes.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he said ungraciously;
"perhaps it's a pity I wrote the letter."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>"Perhaps it is," she answered as she went
away and shut the door.</p>

<p>Harry sat up late, swearing at his own
indiscretion and the unaccountability of women.
But he was not prepared for what followed.</p>

<p>The next morning, as he was dressing, a note
was given to him. It said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Dear Harry,
</p>

<p>"After what you told me yesterday, I feel
I never wish to see you again. This is not anger;
but it's incurable. I can't account for it, but it is
there. How you could have been so stupid as to
think I could remain with both you and Romer
in the house with this knowledge between us, I
simply can't understand. How could I help contrasting
his generosity with your self-interested
selfishness? I am not angry any more about Miss
Walmer. I'm quite indifferent. If you married
her to-morrow it would give me no pain. The
only kind thing you can do for me now, and the
one thing I implore, is to go away on any pretext
you like and without seeing me again. To put it
perfectly plainly, Harry, I have changed entirely
since last night. I see everything differently.
Everything <i>is</i> different. Forgive me, but I don't
wish to see you any more.</p>
<div class="right">"<span class="smcap">Valentia</span>.</div>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I will send your photographs and other
things to the studio. I should like you to burn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>mine, but do not send them back. I don't want
to look at anything that reminds me of you. Do
not be angry&mdash;I can't help it. I am so unhappy.</p>

<p class="right">
V.<br />
</p>

<p>"If you don't go I know I shall be seriously ill."</p></div>

<p>After reading this letter Harry was probably
about a thousand times more in love with
Valentia than he had ever been in his life.
Indeed, he felt that he had never cared for her
before. He pretended even to himself to laugh
at it, and walked up and down his room, saying
to himself: "What a couple! What a woman!
What a man! They're unique. No, they're too
wonderful!"</p>

<p>But he didn't succeed in deceiving himself. He
<i>knew</i> that letter was final. He did not give it up
at once. He wrote her three letters. The first,
one of indignant reproach: "<i>You never really
cared for me</i>," and so forth, which she did not
answer; the second, witty and trivial, with
allusions to mountains and molehills and tragedy
queens; the third, desperately imploring her to
see him once before he went away. To the third
one she sent a reply, simply saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please, please go as soon as possible."</p>

<p>After all his emotion and passionate correspondence
it was by this time only about half-past
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>ten. Harry packed, dressed, and went off
to the station, mad with rage. He left no word
for Romer at all. He felt he had better leave
all that to the wife. He had lost her absolutely
and for ever&mdash;and Miss Walmer too.</p>

<p>In prompt response to his wire Van Buren
met him at the station.</p>

<p>And what a wonderful consolation it was to
tell him all about it!</p>

<p>Certainly no man ever had a better audience;
no one more impressed, shocked, delighted,
horrified, amused, grieved, pleased and sympathetic
ever listened to a confidence. For Van
Buren it was as good as a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, a musical
comedy, a <i>feuilleton</i> in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and a
series of snapshots from the homes of the upper
classes&mdash;all in one. Never in his life had he
heard anything so intensely English. The story
gave him the acute, objective, artistic joy that
one takes in the best literature, an intellectual
pleasure that is usually more or less mingled
with the merely spiteful satisfaction that we are
accused of taking in the misfortunes of our best
friends. And how well Harry told it!</p>

<p>His style was perfect. It was brilliancy, charm,
humour, and pathos; he laughed at himself, and
yet made himself an object of real sympathy,
without losing either his dignity or his dash.</p>

<p>He knew that his confidence aroused enormous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>interest, and to him that was a great gratification.
And so Harry drowned his sorrows in talk, as
other men drown theirs in wine, or in sport, or
in taking some violent step. He intoxicated and
soothed himself with conversation.</p>

<p>But Harry was not an unpractical man&mdash;not
one of those for whom words take place of
actions&mdash;and he could face facts. Valentia was
irrevocably lost to him. To attempt to regain
Miss Walmer, although it might perhaps not be
impossible, would make him ridiculous. The
letter he had written at Romer's dictation had
been too definite. He would give himself away
hopelessly as a fortune-hunter if he tried to go
back on that. Besides, he was absolutely sick of it
all, and if he was more in love with Valentia
than he had ever supposed himself to be because
she no longer wanted him, he disliked the
thought of Miss Walmer far more than he ever
had before, because he was convinced she would
forgive him and be devoted to him even now.</p>

<p>Van Buren had taken the knock, as he
expressed it, using with relish the English slang
phrase, with regard to Daphne, and he had
made up his mind to return to New York. Under
the circumstances he now had little difficulty in
persuading Harry to come out with him right
away. He undertook to provide for his friend's
future, and that he should make a fortune in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>Bank, and perhaps when this was agreed upon
Van Buren had never been so happy. He was far
more genuinely a man's man than was Harry.
He regarded women from the point of view of
the well-bred American&mdash;with deference, a sort
of distant tenderness, a most chivalrous and
gentle respect. He looked upon them as
ornamental and as delightful adjuncts to life,
like flowers in a ball-room, but not seriously as
part of it. Nor, either, as mere toys. He placed
women far more highly than Harry did; he
thought everything should be done for them,
given to them, that they had a right to any
position they were able to hold, that they should
be treated with reverence, consideration, liberality ...
and even justice; but&mdash;he could do
without them. Harry couldn't. And so they
would always continue to fall in love with Harry,
and to find Van Buren a little dull.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When Romer arrived at the Green Gate that
afternoon he found Valentia sitting alone in the
drawing-room. Her hands were clasped, she had
a serious, anxious, thoughtful expression that he
had never seen before. He was surprised at the
painful start it gave him to see her again, but he
came in defying this sensation.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he said, in what he meant to be a
perfectly easy manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>He glanced round the room.</p>

<p>"Where's Harry?"</p>

<p>"Harry's gone," said Valentia, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, has he?"</p>

<p>Romer walked to the window. He looked at
her dress, a white dress that he liked, but did not
meet her eyes. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, he's gone. When is he coming back?"</p>

<p>"Never," she said.</p>

<p>Romer didn't answer, nor ask why.</p>

<p>After a minute he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where's Daphne?"</p>

<p>"Gone to stay with Mrs. Foster for a week."</p>

<p>"Oh! Who's coming down to-day?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. I thought perhaps you wouldn't
mind&mdash;being alone, I mean." She spoke without
her usual fluency.</p>

<p>He stood staring out of the window into the
quiet, damp garden. Then he turned slowly
round and looked at her. He looked at her little
feet in their little white laced shoes; at the slim,
narrow line of the white dress; at the hands
clasped in her lap....</p>

<p>And he felt a sudden pang of cruel, realistic
jealousy. But he looked at her eyes and saw
tears in them, and, pitying her, he crushed it
down for ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>The marvellous instinct with which women
are usually credited seems too often to desert
them on the only occasions when it would be of
any real use. One would say it was there for
trivialities only, since in a crisis they are usually
dense, fatally doing the wrong thing. It is
hardly too much to say that most domestic
tragedies are caused by the feminine intuition
of men and the want of it in women. Fortunately,
Valentia's feeling of remorseful tenderness towards
Romer enabled her to read him now.
Of course she would have loved to cry, to explain
at great length, to beg him to forgive her and
have a reconciliation. But something told her
that he could not have borne it; that the subject
must never be touched; that she must spare him
any reference to it&mdash;any scene.</p>

<p>So she said nothing.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And, during the curious silence, he gradually
and slowly took in the soothing facts. He
regained his sense of proportion, of perspective.
He saw she was disillusioned about Harry; he
felt that the infatuation was over; and, what
was more, he realised, to his unutterable relief,
that she was not going to talk about it. How he
dreaded that terrible explicitness of women,
their passion for tidying up, their love of labels!
He would not even have to hear it called a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>sealed subject, and he would not have to say
anything at all.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He looked out of the window again, began to
whistle in a slightly embarrassed way, and then
said casually&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's come out, Val. The lawn wants
mowing."</p>


<p class="center padding">THE END</p>
